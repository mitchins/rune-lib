Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\n\n\"How so? How can it affect them?\"\n\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\n\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\n\n\"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\"\n\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.\"\n\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\"\n\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\n\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.\"\n\nElizabeth entered the room at that moment, having heard her parents' animated discussion from the hallway. She had been reading in the garden when the sound of her mother's excited voice drew her inside.\n\n\"What are you discussing so intently?\" Elizabeth asked, taking a seat near the window.\n\nMrs. Bennet immediately launched into her explanation about Mr. Bingley, while Mr. Bennet watched his second daughter with an amused expression. Elizabeth listened patiently to her mother's enthusiastic description of their new neighbor's fortune and eligibility.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary was practicing at the pianoforte in the next room, her diligent scales providing a steady background to the conversation.

{"story_id": "colour_of_magic_extract", "text": "Fire roared through the bifurcated city of Ankh-Morpork. Where it licked the Wizards' Quarter it burned blue and green and was even laced with strange sparks of the eighth colour, octarine; where its outriders found their way into the vats and oil stores all along Merchants Street it progressed in a series of blazing fountains and explosions; in the Streets of the perfume blenders it burned with a sweetness; where it touched bundles of rare and dry herbs in the storerooms of the drugmasters it made men go mad and talk to God.\n\n By now the whole of downtown Ankh-Morpork was alight, and the richer and worthier citizens of Ankh on the far bank were bravely responding to the situation by feverishly demolishing the bridges. But already the ships in the Morpork docks - laden with grain, cotton and timber, and coated with tar - were blazing merrily and, their moorings burnt to ashes, were breasting the river Ankh on the ebb tide, igniting riverside palaces and bowers as they drifted like drowning fireflies towards the sea. In any case, sparks were riding the breeze and touching down far across the river in hidden gardens and remote brickyards. The smoke from the merry burning rose miles high, in a wind-sculpted black column that could be seen across the whole of the Discworld. It was certainly impressive from the cool, dark hilltop a few leagues away, where two figures were watching with considerable interest.\n\n The taller of the pair was chewing on a chicken leg and leaning on a sword that was only marginally shorter than the average man. If it wasn't for the air of wary intelligence about him it might have been supposed that he was a barbarian from the hubland wastes.\n\n His partner was much shorter and wrapped from head to toe in a brown cloak. Later, when he has occasion to move, it will be seen that he moves lightly, cat-like.\n\n The two had barely exchanged a word in the last twenty minutes except for a short and inconclusive argument as to whether a particularly powerful explosion had been the oil bond store or the workshop of Kerible the Enchanter. Money hinged on the fact.\n\n Now the big man finished gnawing at the bone and tossed it into the grass, smiling ruefully.\n\n \"There go all those little alleyways,\" he said. \"I liked them.\"\n\n \"All the treasure houses,\" said the small man. He added thoughtfully, \"Do gems burn, I wonder? 'Tis said they're kin to coal.\"\n\n \"All the gold, melting and running down the gutters,\" said the big one, ignoring him. \"And all the wine, boiling in the barrels.\"\n\n \"There were rats,\" said his brown companion.\n\n \"Rats, I'll grant you.\"\n\n \"It was no place to be in high summer.\"\n\n \"That, too. One can't help feeling, though, a well, a momentary-\"\n\n He trailed off, then brightened. \"We owed old Fredor at the Crimson Leech eight silver pieces,\" he added. The little man nodded.\n\n They were silent for a while as a whole new series of explosions carved a red line across a hitherto dark section of the greatest city in the world. Then the big man stirred\n\n \"Weasel?\"\n\n \"Yes?\"\n\n \"I wonder who started it?\"\n\n The small swordsman known as the Weasel said nothing. He was watching the road in the ruddy light. Few had come that way since the widershins gate had been one of the first to collapse in a shower of white-hot embers.\n\n But two were coming up it now. The Weasel's eyes always at their sharpest in gloom and halflight, made out the shapes of two mounted men and some sort of low beast behind them. Doubtless a rich merchant escaping with as much treasure as he could lay frantic hands on. The Weasel said as much to his companion, who sighed.\n\n \"The status of footpad ill suits us,\" said the barbarian, \"but as you say, times are hard and there are no soft beds tonight.\"\n\n He shifted his grip on his sword and, as the leading rider drew near, stepped out onto the road with a hand held up and his face set in a grin nicely calculated to reassure yet threaten.\n\n \"Your pardon, sir-\" he began.\n\n The rider reined in his horse and drew back his hood. The big man looked into a face blotched with superficial burns and punctuated by tufts of singed beard. Even the eyebrows had gone.\n\n \"Bugger off,\" said the face. \"You're Bravd the Hublander, aren't you?\"\n\n Bravd became aware that he had fumbled the initiative.\n\n \"Just go away, will you?\" said the rider. \"I just haven't got time for you, do you understand?\" He looked around and added: \"That goes for your shadow-loving fleabag partner too, wherever he's hiding.\"\n\n The Weasel stepped up to the horse and peered at the dishevelled figure.\n\n \"Why, it's Rincewind the wizard, isn't it?\" he said in tones of delight, meanwhile filing the wizard's description of him in his memory for leisurely vengeance. \"I thought I recognized the voice.\"\n\n Bravd spat and sheathed his sword. It was seldom worth tangling with wizards, they so rarely had any treasure worth speaking of.\n\n \"He talks pretty big for a gutter wizard,\" he muttered.\n\n \"You don't understand at all,\" said the wizard wearily. \"Iím so scared of you my spine has turned to jelly, it's just that Iím suffering from an overdose of terror right now. I mean, when Iíve got over that then I'll have time to be decently frightened of you.\"\n\n The Weasel pointed towards the burning city. \"Youíve been through that?\" he asked.\n\n The wizard rubbed a red, raw hand across his eyes. \"I was there when it started. See him? Back there?\" He pointed back down the road to where his travelling companion was still approaching, having adopted a method of riding that involved falling out of the saddle every few seconds.\n\n \"Well?\" said Weasel.\n\n \"He started it,\" said Rincewind simply. Bravd and Weasel looked at the figure, now hopping across the road with one foot in a stirrup.\n\n \"Fire-raiser, is he?\" said Bravd at last.\n\n \"No,\" said Rincewind. \"Not precisely. Let's just say that if complete and utter chaos was lightning, then he'd be the sort to stand on a hilltop in a thunderstorm wearing wet copper armour and shouting \"All gods are bastards\". Got any food?\"\n\n \"There's some chicken,\" said Weasel. \"in exchange for a story.\"\n\n \"What's his name?\" said Bravd, who tended to lag behind in conversations.\n\n \"Twoflower.\"\n\n \"Twoflower?\" said Bravd. \"What a funny name.\"\n\n \"You,\" said Rincewind, dismounting, \"do not know the half of it. Chicken, you say?\"\n\n \"Devilled,\" said Weasel. The wizard groaned.\n\n \"That reminds me,\" added the Weasel, snapping his fingers, \"there was a really big explosion about, oh, half an hour ago.\"\n\n \"That was the oil bond store going up,\" said Rincewind, wincing at the memory of the burning rain.\n\n Weasel turned and grinned expectantly at his companion, who grunted and handed over a coin from his pouch. Then there was a scream from the roadway, cut off abruptly. Rincewind did not look up from his chicken.\n\n \"One of the things he can't do, he can't ride a horse,\" he said. Then he stiffened as if sandbagged by a sudden recollection, gave a small yelp of terror and dashed into the gloom. When he returned, the being called Twoflower was hanging limply over his shoulder. It was small and skinny, and dressed very oddly in a pair of knee length britches and a shirt in such a violent and vivid conflict of colours that Weasel's fastidious eye was offended even in the half-light.\n\n \"No bones broken, by the feel of things,\" said Rincewind. He was breathing heavily. Bravd winked at the Weasel and went to investigate the shape that they assumed was a pack animal.\n\n \"You'd be wise to forget it,\" said the wizard, without looking up from his examination of the unconscious Twoflower. \"Believe me. A power protects it.\"\n\n \"A spell?\" said Weasel, squatting down.\n\n \"No-oo. But magic of a kind, I think. Not the usual sort. I mean, it can turn gold into copper while at the same time it is still gold, it makes men rich by destroying their possessions, it allows the weak to walk fearlessly among thieves, it passes through the strongest doors to leach the most protected treasuries. Even now it has me enslaved - so that I must follow this madman willynilly and protect him from harm. It's stronger than you, Bravd. It is, I think, more cunning even than you, Weasel.\"\n\n \"What is it called then, this mighty magic?\"\n\n Rincewind shrugged. \"in our tongue it is reflected-sound-as-of-underground-spirits. Is there any wine?\"\n\n \"You must know that I am not without artifice where magic is concerned,\" said Weasel. \"only last year did Iñ assisted by my friend there ñ part the notoriously powerful Archmage of Ymitury from his staff, his belt of moon jewels and his life, in that approximate order. I do not fear this reflected-sound-of-underground-spirits of which you speak. However,\" he added, \"you engage my interest. Perhaps you would care to tell me more?\"\n\n Bravd looked at the shape on the road. It was closer now, and clearer in the pre-dawn light. It looked for all the world like añ\n\n \"A box on legs?\" he said.\n\n \"I'll tell you about it,\" said Rincewind. \"if there's any wine, that is.\"\n\n Down in the valley there was a roar and a hiss. Someone more thoughtful than the rest had ordered to be shut the big river gates that were at the point where the Ankh flowed out of the twin city. Denied its usual egress, the river had burst its banks and was pouring down the fire-ravaged streets. Soon the continent of flame became a series of islands, each one growing smaller as the dark tide rose. And up from the city of fumes and smoke rose a broiling cloud of steam, covering the stars. Weasel thought that it looked like some dark fungus or mushroom.\n\n The twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork, of which all the other cities of time and space are, as it were, mere reflections, has stood many assaults in its long and crowded history and has always risen to flourish again. So the fire and its subsequent flood, which destroyed everything left that was not flammable and added a particularly noisome flux to the survivors' problems, did not mark its end. Rather it was a fiery punctuation mark, a coal-like comma, or salamander semicolon, in a continuing story.\n\n Several days before these events a ship came up the Ankh on the dawn tide and fetched up, among many others, in the maze of wharves and docks on the Morpork shore. It carried a cargo of pink pearls, milk-nuts, pumice, some official letters for the Patrician of Ankh, and a man.\n\n It was the man who engaged the attention of Blind Hugh, one of the beggars on early duty at Pearl Dock. He nudged Cripple Wa in the ribs, and pointed wordlessly.\n\n Now the stranger was standing on the quayside watching several straining seamen carry a large brass-bound chest down the gangplank. Another man, obviously the captain, was standing beside him. There was about the seaman - every nerve in Blind Hugh's body, which tended to vibrate in the presence of even a small amount of impure gold at fifty paces, screamed into his brain - the air of one anticipating imminent enrichment.\n\n Sure enough, when the chest had been deposited on the cobbles, the stranger reached into a pouch and there was the flash of a coin. Several coins. Gold. Blind Hugh, his body twanging like a hazel rod in the presence of water, whistled to himself. Then he nudged Wa again, and sent him scurrying off down a nearby alley into the heart of the city. When the captain walked back onto his ship, leaving the newcomer looking faintly bewildered on the quayside, Blind Hugh snatched up his begging cup and made his way across the street with an ingratiating leer. At the sight of him the stranger started to fumble urgently with his money pouch.\n\n \"Good day to thee, sire,\" Blind Hugh began, and found himself looking up into a face with four eyes in it. He turned to runÖ\n\n \"!\" said the stranger, and grabbed his arm. Hugh was aware that the sailors lining the rail of the ship were laughing at him. At the same time his specialised senses detected an overpowering impression of money. He froze. The stranger let go and quickly thumbed through a small black book he had taken from his belt. Then he said \"Hallo.\"\n\n \"What?\" said Hugh. The man looked blank.\n\n \"Hallo?\" he repeated, rather louder than necessary and so carefully that Hugh could hear the vowels tinkling into place.\n\n \"Hallo yourself,\" Hugh riposted. The stranger smiled widely, fumbled yet again in the pouch. This time his hand came out holding a large gold coin. It was in fact slightly larger than an 8,000-dollar Ankhian crown and the design on it was unfamiliar, but it spoke inside Hugh's mind in a language he understood perfectly. My current owner, it said, is in need of succour and assistance; why not give it to him, so you and me can go off somewhere and enjoy ourselves?\n\n Subtle changes in the beggar's posture made the stranger feel more at ease. He consulted the small book again.\n\n \"I wish to be directed to an hotel, tavern, lodging house, inn, hospice, caravanserai,\" he said.\n\n \"What, all of them?\" said Hugh, taken aback.\n\n \"?\" said the stranger.\n\n Hugh was aware that a small crowd of fishwives, shellfish diggers and freelance gawpers were watching them with interest.\n\n \"Look,\" he said, \"I know a good tavern, is that enough?\" He shuddered to think of the gold coin escaping from his life. He'd keep that one, even if Ymor confiscated all the rest. And the big chest that comprised most of the newcomer's luggage looked to be full of gold, Hugh decided. The four-eyed man looked at his book.\n\n \"I would like to be directed to an hotel, place of repose, tavern, añ\"\n\n \"Yes, all right. Come on then,\" said Hugh hurriedly. He picked up one of the bundles and walked away quickly. The stranger, after a moment's hesitation, strolled after him.\n\n A train of thought shunted its way through Hugh's mind. Getting the newcomer to the Broken Drum so easily was a stroke of luck, no doubt of it, and Ymor would probably reward him. But for all his new acquaintance's mildness there was something about him that made Hugh uneasy, and for the life of him he couldn't figure out what it was. Not the two extra eyes, odd though they were. There was something else. He glanced back. The little man was ambling along in the middle of the street, looking around him with an expression of keen interest.\n\n Something else Hugh saw nearly made him gibber.\n\n The massive wooden chest, which he had last seen resting solidly on the quayside, was following on its master's heels with a gentle rocking gait. Slowly, in case a sudden movement on his part might break his fragile control over his own legs, Hugh bent slightly so that he could see under the chest.\n\n There were lots and lots of little legs. Very deliberately, Hugh turned around and walked very carefully towards the Broken Drum.", "characters": [{"name": "Rincewind", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Twoflower", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Bravd the Hublander", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "The Weasel", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Weasel"]}, {"name": "Kerible the Enchanter", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Fredor", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Blind Hugh", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Cripple Wa", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Ymor", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "classic", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0035}}
{"story_id": "the_ships_of_merior_extract", "text": "On the morning the Fellowship sorcerer who had crowned the King at\n\nOstermere fared northward on the old disused road, the five years of peace\n\nprecariously re-established since the carnage that followed the Mist-\n\nwraith's defeat as yet showed no sign of breaking.\n\nThe moment seemed unlikely for happenstance to intrude and shape a\n\nspiralling succession of events to upend loyalties and kingdoms. Havish's\n\ncoastal landscape with its jagged, shady valleys wore the mottled greens\n\nof late spring. Dew still spangled the leaf-tips, touched brilliant by early\n\nsunlight. Asandir rode in his shirtsleeves, the dark, silver-banded mantle\n\nlately worn for the royal coronation folded inside his saddle pack. Hair\n\nof the same fine silver blew uncovered in the gusts that whipped off the\n\nsea; that tossed the clumped bracken on the hill crests and fanned gorse\n\nagainst lichened outcrops of quartz rock. The black stud who bore him\n\nstrode hock-deep in grass, alone beneath cloudless sky. Wildflowers\n\nthrashed by its passage sweetened the air with perfume and the jagging\n\nflight of disturbed bees.\n\nFor the first time in centuries of service, Asandir was solitary, and on\n\nan errand of no pressing urgency. The ruthless war, the upsets to rule\n\nand to trade that had savaged the north in the wake of the Mistwraith's\n\nimprisonment had settled, if not into the well-governed order secured for\n\nHavish, then at least into patterns that confined latent hatreds to the\n\navenues of statecraft and politics. Better than most, Asandir knew the\n\nrespite was fated not to last. His memories were bitter and hurtful, of\n\nthe great curse cast by the Mistwraith to set both its captors at odds; the\n\nland's restoration to clear sky bought at a cost of two mortal destinies\n\nand the land's lasting peace.\n\nUnless the Fellowship sorcerers could find means to break\n\nDesh-thiere's geas of hatred against the royal half-brothers whose gifts\n\nbrought its bane, the freed sunlight that warmed the growing eart\n\nyet be paid for in blood. With the restored throne of Havish firml'\n\nits crowned heir, Asandir at last rode to join his colleagues in thei\n\nto unbind the Mistwraith's two victims from the vicious throe\n\nvengeance.\n\nRelaxed in rare contentment, too recently delivered from cent~\n\nsunless damp to take the hale spring earth for granted, he let hi\n\nsoar with the winds. The road he had chosen was years overgrow:\n\nmore than a crease that meandered through thorn and brushb\n\nre-emerge where the growth was browsed close by deer. Desl:\n\nbanished mists, the townsmen still held uneasy fears of open spac~\n\nthe sites of forgotten mysteries. Northbound travellers innately p~\n\nto book their passage by ship.\n\nUntroubled by the after-presence of Paravian spirits, not at all di:\n\nby the foundations of ancient ruins that underlay the hammocks\n\nroses, the sorcerer rode with his reins looped. He followed the wa\n\nout misstep, guided by memories that predated the most we~\n\nbroken wall. His appearance of reverie was deceptive. At each n\n\nmage-heightened senses resonated with the natural energies tl~\n\nrounded him. The sun on his shoulders became a benedictio~\n\ncounterpoint and celebration to the ringing reverberation that w~\n\nstriking shadow off edges of wild stone.\n\nWhen a dissonance snagged in the weave, reflex and habit s\n\nAsandir's complaisance. His powers of perception tightened to tr\n\nimmediate cause.\n\nWhatever bad news approached from the south, his mount'\n\nsenses caught no sign. The stallion snorted, shook out his mane,\n\nAsandir rein him over to the verge of the trail. Long minutes\n\ndrum roll of galloping hooves startled the larks to songless flight\n\nthe messenger on his labouring mount hove into view, the sorc~\n\nhis saddle, frowning; while the stud, bored with waiting, cropper\n\nThe courier wore royal colours, the distinctive scarlet tabard a~\n\nhawk blazon of the king's personal service snapped into creases\n\nthe breeze. No common message bearer, he owned the carriage of -~\n\npion fighter. But the battle-brash courage that graced his reputati\n\nmissing as he hauled his horse to a prancing, head-shaking halt.\n\nThe man was a fool, who eagerly brought trouble to the ear of a i\n\nship sorcerer.\n\nBriskly annoyed, Asandir spoke before the king's rider could\n\nhis uncertainty. 'I know you were sent by your liege. If my spel\n\nDakar is cause and root of some problem, I say now, as I told his ~\n\nand the realm's steward on my departure: there is no possible di~\n\nthat might stem from an apprentice's misdeeds that your High\n\njustice cannot handle.'\n\nThe messenger nursed lathered reins to divert his eye-rolling\n\nfrom her sidewards crabsteps through the bracken. 'Begging pardon, Sor-\n\ncerer. But Dakar got himself drunk. There was a fight.' Sweating pale\n\nbefore Asandir's displeasure, he finished in a crisp rush. 'Your spell-\n\nbinder's got himself knifed and King Eldit's healers say he'll bleed to\n\ndeath.'\n\n'Oh, indeed?' The words bit the quiet like sheared metal. Asandir's\n\nbrows cocked up. Features laced over with creases showed a moment of\n\nfierce surprise. Then he started his black up from a mouthful of grass\n\nand spun him thundering back toward the city.\n\nAlone in the derelict roadway on a sidling, race-bred horse, the royal\n\ncourier had no mind to linger. He was not clan kindred, to feel at ease\n\nin the wild places where the old stones lay carved with uncanny patterns\n\nto snag and bewitch a man's thoughts. The instant his over-strung mare\n\nquit her tussle with the bit, he nursed her along at a trot, relieved to be\n\nspared the company of a sorcerer any right-thinking mortal knew better\n\nthan to presume not to fear.\n\nThe city known as the jewel of the southwest coast flung an ungainly\n\nsprawl of battlements across the crown of a cove. Built over warrens of\n\nlimestone caves once used as a smuggler's haven, the architecture\n\nreflected twelve centuries of changing tastes, battered as much by storms\n\nas by war, and bearing like layers in sediment the mismatched masonry of\n\nrefortifications and repairs. Sea trade provided the marrow of Ostermere's\n\nwealth. Walls of tawny brick abutted bulwarks of native limestone, scab-\n\nrous with moss and smothered in lee-facing crannies by salt-stunted run-\n\nners of wild ivy. The whole overlooked a series of weathered ledges that\n\ncommanded a west-facing inlet, each tier crusted with half-timber shops\n\nand slate-roofed mansions still gay with bunting and gold streamers from\n\ncelebration of the king's accession. If the merchant galleys docked along\n\nthe seaside gates no longer flew banners at their mastheads, if the guards\n\nby the harbourmaster's office had shed ceremonial accoutrements for\n\nboiled leather hauberks and plain steel, a charge of excitement yet\n\nlingered.\n\nIn all the realm, this city had been honoured as the royal seat until the\n\nwalls at Telmandir could be raised out of ruin and restored to the splen-\n\ndours of years past. An alertness like frost clung to the men hand-picked\n\nfor the royal guard. Out of pride for their youthful sovereign, they had\n\nthe unused north postern winched open and the shanty market that\n\nencroached upon its bailey cleared of beggars and squatters' stalls when\n\nAsandir's stallion clattered through.\n\nIn a courtyard still gloomy under overhanging tenements, the sorcerer\n\ndismounted. He tossed his reins to a barefoot boy groom grown familiar\n\nwith the stud through the months of change as town governance\n\nhad been replaced by sovereign monarchy. Without pause for greeting,\n\nAsandir strode off, scattering geese and a loose pig from the pud\n\nrun-off by the wash house. He dodged through men in sweaty tunics\n\nunloaded tuns from an ale dray, avoided a bucket-bearing scullion\n\ncrossed without mishap through the tumbling brown melee of a ~\n\nhound bitch's cavorting pups.\n\nJust arrived, all but brushed aside with the same brisk lack of cerem\n\nthe captain of Ostermere's garrison pumped on fat legs to join the\n\ncerer. A capricious gust snatched his unbelted surcoat. Clutching sc:\n\nbroadcloth with both hands to escape getting muffled by his clothin~\n\nrelayed facts with a directness at odds with his untidy turnout.\n\n'It was a damnfool accident, the Mad Prophet so drunken he c,\n\nbarely stand upright. He'd visited the kitchens to meet a maid he clai\n\nhe'd an assignation with. Muddled as he was, he kissed the wrong d\n\nHer husband came in at just the right time to lose his temper.'

Then I don’t have to do it twice.’\n\nJonathan nodded. ‘That is a good idea. That all the luggage you’ve got?’ He nodded toward the small bag she was carrying.\n\n‘Uh-huh. Fabricators are a wonderful invention and, to be honest, I don’t have all that much suitable for Topeka weather.’\n\n‘It’s March. Almost temperate.’\n\nFox looked up at the sun, high in the sky. ‘Dad, it’s pushing twenty, Celsius. New York is barely in double figures.’\n\n‘Better get you out of the sun then, before you melt.’\n\n‘Not much chance of that.’ Which was very true given her current state, but she was saving all that for when she got home. ‘Still, I want to get home and tell you both the news, and then I can get on with the resting part of this.’\n\n‘We’re both happy you wanted to take your medical leave here.’ He took her bag from her and tossed it into the back of the sedan before opening the passenger door for her.\n\nGrinning at him, Fox waited until he got in the other side before saying, ‘Have you been practising being a gentleman for all these political dinner parties I’m sure you attend now?’\n\n‘We don’t. Many of them anyway. Uh… Your mother… has been upset since we heard what happened. She’s going to be a bit emotional about this.’\n\nThey did not know the half of it, but… ‘I kind of figured she might be. How are you two doing? How’s the Watch doing?’\n\n‘Good, aside from worry, and rapidly improving.’ Jonathan paused for a second, and then clearly decided that the Watch was a safe topic for now. ‘I won’t say the first few weeks weren’t testing, but people are starting to trust that the Watch is going to be able to handle things when NAPA shuts down. There have been one or two reprimands, but mostly for failing to keep up with paperwork. No one’s reported any problems with undue use of force or favouritism. I think things are working out pretty well.’\n\n‘How about the investigations side of things?’\n\n‘Nothing major’s come up. A few robberies of one sort or another. We called in Ray Rogers just to support a percentage of the investigations really. He’s happy with the way the Watch officers are handling minor stuff like that and those support vests are working perfectly.’\n\n‘Good,’ Fox said. ‘I’m supposed to be out here taking it easy. I’d hate to have to kick anyone’s butt.’\n\n‘No butt-kicking required. Don’t worry about it.’\n\nFox looked out the window as the sedan hurried north into the city. Thinking about it, kicking someone’s behind might have done her some good. ‘I won’t.’ There were plenty of other things to worry about…\n\n~~\n\nAndrea Meridian started crying as soon as Fox stepped out of the car, bolted forward, and wrapped her arms around her daughter’s neck. There was mumbling and wailing which Fox was fairly sure was in no language previously heard on Earth: words were certainly hard to make out anyway.\n\n‘Mom… Mom… Mom, do you think we could maybe take this inside before my shirt dissolves?’\n\nAndrea let go, backed up, and punched Fox in the shoulder. ‘I have a right to be upset after what happened to you.’\n\n‘Well, yes, but don’t you want to save some for when you’ve heard the full story?’\n\n‘I thought we had…’\n\n‘Clearly not, Andrea,’ Jonathan said, walking around the car. ‘I need to take this back in a bit, but I’d like to find out what we weren’t told before that.’\n\nFox nodded. ‘You could start by telling me what you were told so I don’t have to go over it all again.’\n\n‘Ray Rogers came over to tell us you’d been kidnapped,’ Andrea said as they migrated toward the house. ‘I was worried, very worried, but he said that Palladium was putting every resource into finding you.’\n\n‘He didn’t hold back,’ Jonathan added. ‘He told us it was that Grant guy, or they thought it was. There was going to be a time limit on finding you alive, but that it was likely as much down to how long you could keep going and we knew you were strong.’ He paused. ‘Kitchen or lounge?’\n\n‘Lounge,’ Fox said.\n\n‘Coffee? Something stronger?’\n\n‘Not right now. So I assume they told you they’d found me?’\n\n‘Kit was keeping us up to date from New York. Mostly it was “no news right now, sorry,” but then she dropped us a message saying she’d located your general area, and then it was “we found her!”’\n\n‘And then Jackson Martins called from Japan!’ Andrea said, sounding as though this was tantamount to a personal message from God. ‘He… didn’t hold back either. He told us you were in bad shape, but he assured us he would make sure you came out of it okay.’\n\n‘Called us again from New York,’ Jonathan said. He pointed at the chair he usually used, indicating that Fox should sit there, and then took the sofa beside Andrea. ‘He said you were getting worse, but he was taking you up to some research station on the Moon because it had the latest equipment. That man really thinks the world of you.’\n\n‘Yeah, well…’ Fox sat down. It felt kind of like the hot seat of an interrogation, but… ‘I saved Terri, twice. I think he overcompensates, but he doesn’t.’\n\n‘I can see his point. We got a list of injuries. We assumed there was going to be some cybernetics involved. How much did they have to replace?’\n\nFox forced a smile. ‘Okay. They told you about the coma?’ There was nodding. ‘I developed a brain haemorrhage, and there was damage to my brain stem along with the severed spinal cord further down. Grant also used an experimental nanodrug on me to accelerate my healing while he was… Well, he used it too much and it trashed my natural ability to heal. So, I was crippled below the waist, my body was basically operating only because they patched me into a life support system, I wouldn’t wake up, and my body wasn’t actually healing.’\n\n‘Oh,’ Andrea said, eyes wide.\n\n‘Yeah. Jackson took me up to Jenner. Uh, that’s our research station in the Jenner Crater, on the far side. It’s where we do our really secret research. Terri was already up there working on something I can’t tell you about, and Jackson discussed some options with her.’\n\n‘I understood Teresa Martins was an AI specialist,’ Jonathan said, frowning.\n\n‘She is, mostly, but she has some fairly novel software projects aside from her normal AI stuff and Jackson wanted her to consider one of them.’\n\n‘A software project?’\n\n‘Yeah. Well, software, nanotechnology… Terri did the operating software for the Yliaster system, which is all nanomachines. But… Look, they had a few options, but none of them were exactly safe. The brain damage was pretty severe and the cybernetic technicians were pretty unsure about some sort of spinal implant working. They’re working on a medical application of Yliaster which could have done the repairs, possibly, but they’re nowhere near ready to try it on a living human. They considered freezing me until they could have it ready, but cryogenic technology isn’t exactly a sure thing yet…’\n\n‘But you’re here,’ Andrea said. ‘You look… like nothing happened to you. Just the same as you did. They must have done something.’\n\nFox looked down at her hands. ‘It’s called Project Akh. Using ultra-high-definition MRI and nanomachines, they map out every neuron, every connection in someone’s brain. Then they compile all that data into a database and Terri’s written software which can… execute that database to create an emulation of the original brain. It’s digitising a human, turning them into an infomorph. Uh… It’s a destructive process. I can’t go back. Even if my body was much use in its current state, it doesn’t have a brain for me to inhabit.’\n\n‘Oh my God!’\n\nNot looking up, Fox continued. ‘Jackson felt they had no choice. All the other options were bad. The process is experimental. I’m the first person to go through it, but they were sure it would work. It’s just that all the test animals they tried it on, except one, couldn’t cope outside a virtual environment. Terri was sure a human had the mental capacity to handle it and… Well, apparently I do, but…’\n\n‘Oh my God,’ Andrea repeated and Fox looked up, dreading what she would see. Andrea looked horrified, her hands held up in front of her mouth in anguish. Fox’s heart sank, metaphorically speaking since she no longer had one.\n\n‘So…’ Jonathan began. ‘What we’re looking at is some sort of android body?’\n\n‘Yeah,’ Fox replied. ‘Computer in the chest to run the emulation software.’\n\n‘My God, but they’ve come a long way on realistic skin. I’ve seen some of them in town and you can always tell. I mean… you’re my daughter and I couldn’t.’\n\n‘Well, it’s–’\n\nAndrea was suddenly leaping across the space to wrap her arms around Fox’s neck again. ‘Oh, my poor baby! What you must’ve been through!’\n\n‘Uh…’\n\n‘Let the girl breathe, Andrea,’ Jackson said.\n\n‘She’s in a gynoid body,’ Andrea replied, still holding on. ‘She doesn’t have to. And it’s gynoid, not android. There’s a difference.’\n\n‘Technically true,’ Fox said, ‘but it’s difficult to talk like this.’\n\n‘You’re doing fine. I can’t imagine what it must be like. The first you knew of it was when you woke up? When they… started you up?’\n\n‘Pretty much, yeah. I went to sleep in a hospital room in Tokyo and woke up in what turned out to be a simulation of my apartment, apparently all fixed. I was… a little unreasonable about it.’\n\n‘Understandable,’ Jonathan said. ‘Still having some doubts?’\n\n‘Yes.’\n\n‘Also understandable, but I couldn’t tell. It’s not just the body, the very lifelike gynoid body. You move the same, sound the same, act the same…’\n\nAndrea finally let go and returned to the sofa. ‘You are the same.’\n\n‘Sam said the same thing,’ Fox said. ‘Though Sam noticed that I’m more flexible than I used to be, but he notices things like that. Kit keeps telling me she can’t detect a difference aside from the fact that I keep worrying over it. Jackson and Terri treat me just like they did except for the technical aspects. Marie… She was kind of avoiding me, which is one of the reasons I came out here.’\n\n‘We’re not complaining,’ Jonathan said. ‘Marie will come around. She’s young, probably unsettled by this. She’ll handle it once she’s had a chance to think it over.’\n\n‘I guess I didn’t give her much chance. You two are really okay with this?’\n\n‘I’d prefer it hadn’t been needed, but I don’t care what kind of body you’re in so long as it’s you that’s in there.’\n\n‘Agreed,’ Andrea said, ‘but they did do a remarkable job of replicating the original you. It does help, I suppose.’\n\n‘Huh,’ Fox said. ‘Well, I sleep in a server while this thing recharges. Did they deliver it?’\n\n‘Several MarTech technicians turned up to install a server of some sort in your room,’ Jackson said. ‘I’m glad we’d finished redecorating.’\n\n‘That gets to stay here in case of visits. All I need to handle daily life. Uh, I don’t really need to drink and I can get by on very minimal food, but I can eat and drink normally if I want. It’s just… a bit wasteful.’\n\n‘And you can’t get drunk.’\n\n‘No, sadly, I can’t.’\n\n‘I’ll get drunker for you,’ Andrea said.\n\n‘But more importantly,’ Jonathan went on, ‘how secret is this?’\n\n‘It’s not. I’m the poster child for Project Akh. It’ll be public knowledge soon enough. On the other hand, we’re not making a lot of noise about it yet. Uh, that’s partially because I don’t want to. I need to get used to it. It’s kind of weird. Most of the time, I feel like me. Sometimes I don’t.’\n\n‘I’d imagine that’s natural. Hell, I’m still not quite used to this implant. I feel like a computer sometimes. It just pops things up for me when I think about them too loud.’\n\nFox grinned, this time more genuinely. ‘Finally went ahead with it then?’\n\n‘And no matter what he says,’ Andrea said, ‘he wonders how he did without it.’\n\n‘Yes, yes,’ Jonathan said, ‘I should’ve done it years ago, but my point is that it took some getting used to. Change does. Where is Kit anyway? You mentioned her and she hasn’t popped up to say hello.’\n\nFox tapped her chest. ‘She’s in here. This thing has a fairly powerful computer so we can both run quite comfortably on it. I asked her to let me do this on my own. Uh… I think I was expecting more… of a reaction.’\n\nKit’s avatar, all large green eyes and foxy white tail, appeared beside Fox’s chair. ‘Good afternoon, Mister and Mrs Meridian. I told her you would understand, but she’s convinced people should treat her differently.’\n\n‘Afternoon, Kit,’ Jonathan said, smiling. ‘Well, she’s right, but it’ll be people who don’t know her. And it won’t all be “bad,” though I doubt Fox will see it as good attention.’\n\n‘The Church,’ Andrea said, nodding. ‘I mean, I can’t imagine many of the conventional religions taking this well, but the Church of God’s Mind is going to think you’re some sort of goddess, Tara.’\n\nFox sagged in her seat. ‘No one is to tell Danny Berkewitz about this. No one. Under any circumstances.’\n\nAndrea developed what could only be described as a politician’s smirk. ‘What’s it worth?’\n\n~~\n\n‘So your mother got another social out of you?’ Bart Wade said, smirking.\n\n‘Blackmailed another social out of me,’ Fox replied. She was at the kitchen table, watching Bart and her parents eat. She was drinking wine, to be sociable, but she really did think wasting food on her was just about a crime.\n\nBartholomew Wade was the only other person in Topeka that Fox absolutely had to have in the know regarding her new condition. Even if she had expected more problems with her parents, especially her mother, she had known that Bart would take it in his usual, practical manner, and probably tell her that she was being an idiot. Bart was old, but only physically. His hair was grey, and increasing amounts of his body had been replaced with metal and plastic, but he had had a computer implanted long before Jonathan and his mind was as sharp as ever.\n\n‘Blackmail,’ Andrea said, ‘is such an ugly word. I prefer “persuasion with menaces.”’\n\n‘I’m not sure that’s better,’ Fox countered, ‘but the point is that I wanted you to know I’d beaten you hands down on the cybernetics, Bart, before Friday. That way I don’t have to explain in front of everyone.’\n\nBart gave a shrug. ‘I still hold the Tin Man title for the street. You’re just a visitor, so I can live with it.’\n\n‘I figured you would. Though I recall you saying how big a can of worms this kind of technology was back in January.’\n\n‘Sure is. When the news breaks, you’re going to be up to your neck in political and religious types. You’ll have the Church of God’s Mind demanding that the government legalise it, and they won’t be alone. And you’ll have the religious Right demanding it be outlawed.’\n\n‘And probably that I get turned off. Yeah, I know.’\n\n‘But you have that covered, right?’ Andrea said. ‘You said MarTech had come to some special arrangement for their first subject.’\n\n‘I’m covered,’ Fox agreed. ‘I’m legally the same person. Huh, if the worst ever came to the worst, I could emigrate to Luna City. They have a pretty solid equal rights thing going up there. That’s why the American government agreed to hold my testing there before I was allowed down here.’ She rolled her eyes. ‘That was annoying and pointless.’\n\n‘They were trying to make sure you were you?’ Bart asked.\n\n‘Well, yeah, but it was an IQ test followed by some guy asking me questions I could’ve probably answered with an internet search. Seriously, mother’s maiden name. Name of my first school.’\n\n‘You remembered my maiden name?’ Andrea asked.\n\n‘Barlow. I do actually remember my grandparents, Mom. It was kind of slipshod, but I guess I shouldn’t complain. NAPA sent someone up to interview me too. That was more detailed, but mostly on what happened with Grant and Hannah.’\n\n‘Kit got on the news about that Hannah girl. An AI giving evidence at a hearing and your testimony. You really don’t hold a grudge over her part in this?’\n\n‘I do,’ Kit said from her position behind Fox, perched on one of the work surfaces. ‘Equally, she helped rescue Fox. I am conflicted on the matter.’\n\n‘I…’ Fox frowned. ‘I guess I’m conflicted too. I’ve got some pretty obvious issues with her, but she was almost as much a victim as me and I think she deserves to be tried for what she did, not just turned off and scrapped.’\n\n‘Well,’ Bart said, ‘you set the cat among the pigeons with that one. They’re still trying to decide what to do about it. Might go all the way to the top.’\n\n‘I haven’t been paying a lot of attention to the news recently. Jenner’s pretty isolated and I’ve been avoiding anything controversial since I got back. I’ve got enough controversy of my own.’\n\n‘Fair point. You won’t have seen that the Japanese have stolen MarTech’s thunder then?’\n\n‘Oh?’\n\n‘Some company over there has made the first artificial biological human. Well, not human, obviously, but you know what I mean. Bioroid, they call them.’\n\n‘BioTek were working on it. Are working on it. They needed a variant of Yliaster to make it viable. So they can build an entire adult body instead of growing a cell up to adult size the normal way. An eighteen-year production cycle wasn’t viewed as ideal.’\n\n‘Huh, no, I’d imagine not. Apparently someone in Japan has cracked it. Of course, it’s for sex. If they don’t actually invent something specifically for sex, someone’ll find a way to use it for that pretty quickly.’\n\nAndrea giggled. ‘So true. It seems a shame that the first artificial life we make is for that though.’\n\n‘Alternative is probably some sort of manual labour. Slave labour. Not good either, but I’m bringing the mood down.’ Bart flashed a grin at Andrea. ‘Nice outfit you’re almost wearing, Andy. I see the sparkle hasn’t gone from your renewed love life.’\n\nAndrea blushed, but just a little. Her cropped camisole top and shorts were fairly brief. ‘Jonathan likes it. And so do you, you old letch.’\n\n‘Not denyin’ it. Mind you, you’ve got competition. Your daughter’s not exactly covering herself up and she’s got more to show.’\n\n‘Oh… Don’t remind me. I’ve always been a little envious.’\n\n‘And,’ Fox said, smirking, ‘now there’s no danger of sag. Ever.’\n\nAndrea mock scowled at her daughter. ‘You’re not too old to spank, young lady.’\n\n~~\n\nFox’s old bedroom had been redecorated. Gone were the trappings of a late-teen, replaced with a not-too-modern but certainly updated look in earth tones, which included a double bed that had a rather nice bronze-coloured, embroidered comforter over it. It had been done in the hope that Fox would visit with Jason Deveraux, her boyfriend.\n\n‘We kind of planned to come over before he started his new job,’ Fox said. Her mother was seeing her to bed before joining Jonathan. Andrea was being a little more solicitous than usual, likely still worrying over Fox’s recovery. ‘Then I went and got myself kidnapped…’\n\n‘I’m sure you’ll see him again, Tara,’ Andrea said. ‘I’m sure that bed will see some use at some point.’\n\n‘Well, it’s going to see some now.’ Fox looked at the black box sitting beside the bed, already hooked up to the mains. There were indicator lights on it, showing that it was functional. A small camera mounted on the top was unmoving and there were a couple of cables coiled beside it. ‘I only need four hours’ sleep now, and this thing will be charged before I wake up, but I might still be in there if you come in in the morning.’\n\n‘I’ll let you come down on your own. Take your time. You are supposed to be resting.’\n\n‘Yeah. Look, do you mind if I do this on my own? It’s still a little…’\n\n‘I’ll leave you to it. I’d imagine you can contact our implants if you need anything anyway.’\n\nFox waited for her mother to leave before undressing. Nudity was technically unnecessary, but she had slept naked for a long time and it made things a little easier. She pulled the comforter back on the bed and then picked up the thickest of the two cables. It ended in something that looked like one of those nerve-induction exercise devices people had thought were the answer to exercise without effort decades ago: a cloth belt with a pair of plastic pads attached to it. Strapping the belt around her hips, she made sure the two pads were roughly over her hip joints and closed the fastening.\n\nNext came the second cable, much thinner with a small plug at the end. Reaching behind her neck, she felt under her hair for the small socket hidden away there and pushed the plug in. Almost immediately, a connection notification came through, followed by an authentication exchange panel.\n\n‘All set up for us,’ Kit commented. ‘Jackson is really going out of his way to make sure this works for you.’\n\n‘Yeah, well… He would. He always does.’ Fox started her transfer to the server and climbed into bed, pulling the covers over her. ‘I assume you’re coming over with me.’\n\n‘Of course. I’ve some work to do, and you’ll want someone to talk to when you wake up hours before your parents.’\n\n‘You know, not being able to sleep in is a major fault in this design. Turn off, “sleep” for want of a better word, and four hours later I wake up. Ding! Awake.’ Fox closed her eyes and watched the progress bar on her ba transfer. ‘And they need to give me a faster cable interface. I mean, Terri was talking about using wireless transfers sometimes, but that would take ages.’\n\n‘I know. That’s how I usually travel.’\n\n‘You’re used to it. This is all new to me. It’s so slow…’\n\n‘You could be in Japan in five minutes, ten at the most. You could be on Mars in a day or so instead of weeks.’\n\n‘I suppose that has some utility. If I’ve got a frame to load into once I get there anyway. Does Palladium have contracts on Mars?’\n\n‘There are MarTech facilities on Mars and Venus, as well as the lunar sites, of course. Setting up a body for you on the Moon would be very easy. You need never ride in a rocket ever again.’\n\n‘Huh. Now I see why Jackson wants to do this.’\n\n‘Hmm, yes. He does suffer terribly from space sickness.’\n\nFox smirked. ‘I don’t think that quite covers the depths of his misery. He is a little better when he can have some gravity, but then the Coriolis effect tends to kick in with spin gravity… Yeah, he’d love just being able to radio himself over to Jenner. Transfer’s almost complete. I’ve programmed it to shunt me straight into sleep mode on the other side so… Night, Kit.’\n\n‘Goodnight, Fox. Sleep well.’\n\n‘Oh, like I have a choice…’\n\n28th March.\n\nPossibly one of the most important advances in biotechnology this century, the new Japanese bioroid carried the name Yurei no Ningyo, which seemed to be being translated as Ghost Doll. Fox discovered the reason for the name when she located a video of the launch conference from the Aphrodite Cybernetics facility in the Chiba Industrial Zone.\n\nAphrodite Cybernetics built androids and gynoids more or less exclusively for the pleasure market. They did not come immediately to mind on the list of people who might scoop BioTek to the first artificial humanoid, but they did tinker with biotechnology: their high-end models used cloned skin to give a more realistic look to their robots. This made it strange that the Ghost Doll bioroids did not appear especially realistic. They had pale, almost white, skin with the texture of latex, very red pouting lips, and eyes that always seemed to be opened wide. They were walking rubber sex dolls and Fox found herself wondering what kind of mind came up with something like that.\n\n‘I would suggest it was a male one,’ Kit said when Fox commented on the video. ‘Possibly one born last century. Perhaps the company was unable to create a working model with more natural skin, though it seems more like a specific choice.’\n\n‘Yeah. If I discover BioTek are doing anything like this, I’ll… get very angry about it.’\n\n‘I’m nothing but software, and I find it rather offensive. Perhaps it will fail to sell.’\n\n‘Oh… Don’t count on it. Aside from anything else, they’re selling it as a luxury item. People with more money than sense are going to jump right in. I’d suggest that the Japanese market might be more amenable, but I bet you there are Americans trying to sniff out a way to import one right now. The interesting thing will be to see whether they create a male version.’\n\n‘The market for pleasure androids still lags behind the gynoid market, though it is not far from parity. Have you ever tried one?’\n\n‘No,’ Fox said. ‘Thought about it. There’s something to be said for a boyfriend you can stuff in a closet when you’re bored with him. Of course, now I’m a gynoid girlfriend.’\n\n‘You know, I don’t think Jason will think of it that way. I also think that Jackson would not have been unhappy if you had stopped off at Prokhorov Station on the way to Earth.’\n\n‘Maybe I didn’t want to test Jason’s reaction just then because I felt insecure. I’m still finding myself, Kit. If, and I’m not saying he would have, but if Jason reacted badly… Not sure I could take that right now.’ Fox checked the time. ‘Almost six. I’m getting up. Mom and Dad will think I’ve been replaced by a duplicate, but… I have, so it seems fair.’\n\n~~\n\nIt was a bit after six a.m. when Jonathan and Andrea came down to find Fox sitting at the kitchen table, eating something from a plastic tub which appeared to be Greek yoghurt. The smell of coffee pervaded the room as well.\n\n‘Now I am starting to worry about you,’ Andrea said. ‘Up before us and eating yoghurt?’\n\n‘Yeah, well, this way I don’t walk in on you two kissing like teenagers at a drive-in, and it’s not yoghurt.’\n\nFrowning, Andrea walked over to the table and started reaching a finger toward the tub. ‘It looks like–’\n\n‘Uh… Don’t. Seriously. It’s specifically for my skin. It’s basically protein and nanomachines.’\n\n‘It’s poisonous to humans?’\n\n‘Huh, no. It just tastes absolutely disgusting and it won’t do you any good at all. It’s indigestible and gross, but it’s got everything I need for a glossy coat and wet nose. And I turn off my sense of taste before eating it.’\n\n‘You can do that?’\n\n‘Smell, taste, and touch, if I want. The smell thing is going to come in useful at murder scenes.’\n\nKit appeared beside the table nodding. ‘She is not joking about that last part. Not even a little. You know you don’t need to eat that so often?’\n\nFox gave a shrug. ‘I’m still getting used to what I need. I’d rather have too much stored up than not enough.’\n\n‘And I guess coffee is just a drink now,’ Jonathan said. ‘And you can’t get drunk.’\n\n‘Well, I still like coffee and the taste of alcoholic drinks.’\n\n‘And she can get drunk,’ Kit added. ‘Oh… She can get really drunk. It just takes virtual alcohol to do it. You should have seen her when–’\n\n‘And we are not discussing my drunken episodes on Jenner with my parents.’\n\n‘But it’s funny!’\n\n‘It’s not funny, it’s embarrassing. Don’t think I won’t virtually spank you.’\n\n‘Oh, yes please, mistress!’\n\nFox winced: she had been asking for that. Jonathan burst out laughing. Andrea put her hand over her mouth, eyes wide, and said, ‘Kit!’ The shocked look was somewhat diminished by the fact that she appeared to be trying not to giggle.\n\n‘You’d better not be teaching Belle this sass,’ Fox said.\n\n‘Belle prefers quiet dignity,’ Kit replied, ‘though I think she’s getting there.’ Then she pouted. ‘You can’t be mad at me. I’m paru-kawaii, remember?’\n\n‘I can well believe it,’ Jonathan said, ‘but what does it mean?’\n\n‘Very cute,’ Fox said, ‘in Japanese. Kit’s all famous over there. She gets fan mail and mentions on social media sites, and I heard she was doing the chat show circuit…’\n\n‘What?!’ Kit squeaked. ‘No! No one said anything about– Oh, you’re making fun of me.’\n\nFox smiled and got up to get coffee. ‘The look on your face…’\n\n~~\n\nFox pulled her Q-bug up outside an old industrial building and stepped off, adjusting her cami-top absently before heading for the door. There was little to indicate that this was the Topeka office of Palladium Security Solutions, just a small sign beside the door. However, the fact that the door recognised her ID and opened as she walked up to it did make Fox feel like she still belonged.\n\n‘I thought you were supposed to be on medical leave,’ Ray Rogers said as Fox walked into the office the investigators shared.\n\nFox raised an eyebrow. ‘If I was working, I wouldn’t be here in a tiny little top and denim shorts.’\n\n‘First time I saw you, you were wearing a top like that. I admit, there was less leg on show.’\n\n‘Well, I’m not working. I figured that, since I was in town anyway, I’d come over and see if everyone was settling in okay. Not that you need to settle… And to thank you for sending over my gear and the Q-bug.’\n\nRogers nodded. ‘New housing’s finished. We’re in and it’s all functioning, including the new fabricator. Not much happening, but the Watch has been using us for oversight on a few small cases. It’s all pretty much making sure they’re handling things properly. Uh, they have been.’\n\n‘Great.’ Fox grabbed a seat beside Rogers’s desk and sat down. ‘So how are things with Ray Rogers?’\n\n‘Oh, uh… Well, pretty good… I’ve been, uh, dating…’ There were some snickers from the other people in the office and Rogers flashed a glare around his colleagues.\n\n‘Anyone I know?’\n\n‘Yeah… It’s Crystal Bateson.’ Rogers frowned. ‘You don’t look very surprised.’\n\n‘She asked whether you were single last time I was down here. I’m more surprised that she actually went for it than that you’re dating her. She’s an attractive woman. What does Sandy think?’\n\n‘That it’s great, as far as I can tell. Uh, the age difference is–’\n\n‘Meaningless these days. Unless you’re into the whole “toy boy” thing, of course.’ Fox watched Rogers’s cheeks colour and grinned. ‘I’m happy for you. Both of you. She needs something good in her life. Of course, if you break her heart, I’ll help Sandy skin you.’\n\n‘Huh. If I do that, I’ll hold the knives while you’re doing it. Uh… We got reports through. About your condition, I mean. You’re looking pretty good, but… We were worried about you. Helen and Kit are handling the top-end admin pretty well, no complaints at all, but do you know when you’ll be back on the job?’\n\nFox leaned back in her chair. ‘No… I have a few things to work through. It’s been a tough month.’\n\n‘Yeah, I can imagine.’\n\n~~\n\nThe problem, of course, was that no one could really imagine what Fox was trying to work through. No one with fewer than four legs had ever had to do it before, and Fox was fairly sure that Agnus the digital rat was not going to be much help; the language barrier alone was more or less insurmountable.\n\n‘I don’t believe talking to Agnus would help anyway,’ Kit said as they drove back to Fox’s parents’ house. ‘I don’t believe that her experience really impinges on the problem.’\n\n‘Eyes on the road,’ Fox responded. Kit was driving the bug by remote because she did not get the chance that often.\n\n‘I am quite capable of holding a conversation while driving. Don’t change the subject.’\n\n‘Since I gave you your command keys, you’ve got bossy.’ There was silence for a second or two and then Fox filled it. ‘Okay, why doesn’t Agnus’s experience have a bearing on mine?’\n\n‘Because Agnus was happy being a rat and got on with doing just that. You, however, are not happy getting on with being what you are.’\n\n‘Human?’\n\n‘A detective. You’re quite fit to resume work. You usually work to avoid personal issues, but now you’re using a personal issue to avoid work.’\n\n‘I’m n– Okay, I am. This job cost me… almost everything, Kit. I’m not me any more. I mean, I guess I am, but my real body is in a freezer on the Moon. And that’s only because Terri still entertains the hope that they can fix it up and build me a new brain. I don’t know whether I can do this any more.’\n\n‘I believe you can, and you will. I accept that it may take some time for you to realise that, however. Also, I am pleased to note that you do not seem concerned that you are not yourself. You appear to have accepted that your mind is what makes you Fox Meridian.’\n\n‘People keep telling me I act the same, I still remember all the embarrassing things I’d rather have forgotten when I was sixteen, and I’ve never been much into metaphysics. I can do without existential dilemmas, so unless something comes up to suggest there’s something missing, I am me. I think I am Fox Meridian, therefore I am. Or something. Hell, the real Fox Meridian isn’t going to tell me I’m not. She doesn’t have a brain.’\n\n‘Somehow,’ Kit said, ‘I think that I was happier before you explained your reasoning, but it’s a good start. Have you given any thought to what you would do if you cannot continue your current job?’\n\n‘Of course not. I’m too busy panicking about not being able to do it. Maybe I should take up farming. Dad seems to like it.’\n\nThere was amusement in Kit’s voice when she replied. ‘Somehow, I cannot picture you as a farmer, Fox.’\n\n‘Well… I could be…’", "characters": [{"name": "Fox Meridian", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Jonathan Meridian", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Andrea Meridian", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Kit", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Ray Rogers", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Jackson Martins", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Teresa Martins", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Grant", "role": "ANTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Hannah", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Bart Wade", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Danny Berkewitz", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Jason Deveraux", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Sam", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Marie", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Belle", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Crystal Bateson", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Sandy", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Helen", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Terri", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Jenner", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Akh", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Tara", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Bartholomew", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "classic", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0039}}
{"story_id": "a_memory_called_empire_extract", "text": "And from behind the curve of the large gaseous planet at coordinate B5682.76R1, the Emperor Twelve Solar-Flare arose on the bow of her ship, and she was a radiant blaze flooding all of the void. The rays of her light, reaching outward like the spear-spokes of her throne, struck the metal shells which were the dwelling-places of human beings in Sector B5682, and illuminated them brightly. The sensors of Twelve Solar-Flare’s ship recorded ten of them, each alike to the other, and this number has not increased since. Within the shells the men and women knew not seasons nor growth nor decay, but lived endlessly in orbit without benefit of a planetary home. The largest of these shells called itself Lsel Station, which in the language of its people meant a station that both listened and heard. But the people there had grown strange, and cleaved to themselves, though they were capable of learning language, and immediately began to do so …\n\n—The Expansion History, Book V, lines 72–87, anonymous but attributed to the historian-poet Pseudo-Thirteen River, writing in the reign of the Emperor of All Teixcalaan Three Perigee\n\n* * *\n\nIn order to expedite your travel into the Imperium, Teixcalaan requests the following as proofs of identity: a) a genetic record stating your sole possession of your own genotype, unshared with clonesibs OR a notarized document stating that your genotype is at least 90 percent unique and that no other individual holds LEGAL claim to it; b) an itemized list of goods, chattels, currencies, and objects of idea commerce which you intend to bring with you; c) a work permit from a registered employer in a Teixcalaanli system, signed and notarized, with salary and maintenance information, OR a record of superlative performance on the Teixcalaanli Imperial Examinations OR an invitation by a person, governmental entity, bureau, ministry, or other authorized individual specifying your entrance and exit dates from Imperium space OR evidence of sufficient self-supporting currency …\n\n—Form 721Q, Visa Application Made from Foreign Sectors ALPHABETIC LANGUAGE VARIANT, page 6\n\nMAHIT came down to the City, heart-planet and capital of the Teixcalaanli Empire, in a seed-skiff, a bubble of a ship hardly big enough for her body and her luggage both. She squirted from the side of the imperial cruiser Ascension’s Red Harvest and burned atmosphere on her planetward trajectory, which distorted the view. Thus the first time she saw the City with her own flesh eyes, not in infofiche or holograph or imago-memory, it was haloed in white fire and shone like an endless glittering sea: an entire planet rendered into an ecumenopolis, palatially urban. Even its dark spots—older metropolises not yet clad in metal, decaying urban blight, the harnessed remains of lakes—looked populated. Only the oceans remained untouched, and they gleamed too, a brilliantine blue-turquoise.\n\nThe City was very beautiful and very big. Mahit had been on a fair number of planets, the ones closest to Lsel Station that weren’t completely inimical to human life, and she was nevertheless overcome by awe. Her heart beat faster; her palms went clammy where they gripped her harness. The City appeared exactly as it was always described in Teixcalaanli documents and songs: the jewel at the heart of the Empire. Complete with atmospheric glow.\n\n<That’s what looking at it is meant to make you think,> said her imago. He was a faint staticky taste on the back of her tongue, a flash of grey eyes and sun-dark skin in her peripheral vision. The voice in the back of her head, but not quite her voice: someone around her age, but male, and quicksilver-smug, and as excited to be here as she was. She felt her mouth curve in his smile, a heavier and wider thing than the muscles in her face preferred. They were new to each other. His expressions were very strong.\n\nGet out of my nervous system, Yskandr, she thought at him, gently chiding. An imago—the implanted, integrated memory of one’s predecessor, housed half in her neurology and half in a small ceramic-and-metal machine clasped to her brainstem—wasn’t supposed to take over the host’s nervous system unless the host consented. At the beginning of the partnership, though, consent was complicated. The version of Yskandr inside her mind remembered having a body, and sometimes he used Mahit’s as if it were his own. She worried about it. There was still so much space between them, when they were supposed to be becoming one person.\n\nThis time, though, he withdrew easily: sparking prickles, electric laughter. <As you will. Show me, Mahit? I want to see it again.>\n\nWhen she gazed down at the City again—closer now, the skyport rising to meet her skiff like a flower made of scooping nets—she let the imago look through her eyes and felt his rush of exhilaration as if it were her own.\n\nWhat’s down there, she thought. For you.\n\n<The world,> said her imago, who had been Ambassador from Lsel in the City when he was still a living person and not part of a long chain of live memory. He said it in the Teixcalaanli language, which made it a tautology: the word for “world” and the word for “the City” were the same, as was the word for “empire.” It was impossible to specify, especially in the high imperial dialect. One had to note the context.\n\nYskandr’s context was obfuscating, which Mahit had come to expect of him. She coped. Despite all her years of studying Teixcalaanli language and literature, his fluency had a different quality than hers, the sort that only came from immersive practice.\n\n<The world,> he said again, <but also the edges of the world.> The Empire, but also where the Empire stops.\n\nMahit matched his language and spoke out loud in Teixcalaanli, since there was no one but her in the seed-skiff. “You’ve said something meaningless.”\n\n<Yes,> Yskandr agreed. <When I was ambassador it was my habit to say all sorts of meaningless things. You should try it. It’s quite enjoyable.>\n\nIn the privacy of her body, Yskandr used the most intimate forms of address, as if he and Mahit were clonesibs or lovers. Mahit had never spoken them out loud. She had a natural younger brother back on Lsel Station, the closest she would ever get to a clonesib, but her brother only spoke the Stationers’ language, and calling him “you,” intimate-otherself in Teixcalaanli, would have been both pointless and unkind. She could have said “you” to a few people who had been in those language and literature courses with her—her old friend and classmate Shrja Torel would have taken the compliment correctly, for instance, but Mahit and Shrja hadn’t spoken since Mahit had been picked to be the new Ambassador to Teixcalaan and carry the imago of the previous one. The why of that little breakage between them was obvious, and petty, and Mahit regretted it—and it wasn’t something she was going to get a chance to repair, except by apologetic letter from the center of the Empire both she and Shrja had wanted to see. Which almost certainly wouldn’t help.\n\nThe City had come closer: it filled up the horizon, a vast curve she was falling into. To Yskandr, she thought, I am the Ambassador now. I might speak meaningfully. If I wanted.\n\n<You speak correctly,> Yskandr said, which was the sort of compliment the Teixcalaanlitzlim gave to a still-crèched child.\n\nGravity caught at the seed-skiff and sank into the bones in Mahit’s thighs and forearms, giving her the sensation of spin. It was dizzying. Below her the skyport’s nets flared open. For a moment she thought she was falling, that she would fall all the way to the planet’s surface and smear to paste on the ground.\n\n<It was the same for me,> Yskandr said quickly, in that Stationers’ language that was Mahit’s native tongue. <Don’t be afraid, Mahit. You are not falling. It is the planet.>\n\nThe skyport caught her with hardly a bump.\n\nShe had time to gather herself together. There was some business with the seed-skiff being shunted into a long line of other such vessels, moving along a great conveyor until each one could be identified and come to its assigned gate. Mahit found herself rehearsing what she would say to the imperial citizens on the other side as if she was a first-year student preparing for an oral examination. In the back of her mind, the imago was a watchful, thrumming presence. Every so often he moved her left hand, the fingers tapping along her harness, someone else’s nervous gesture. Mahit wished they’d had longer to get used to each other.\n\nBut she hadn’t undergone the normal process of having an imago implanted, complete with a year or more of integration therapy under the precise care of one of Lsel’s psychotherapists: she and Yskandr had had a scant three months together, and now they were approaching the place where they’d need to work together—work as one person, compiled out of a memory-chain and a new host.\n\nWhen Ascension’s Red Harvest had arrived, hanging in parallel orbit around Lsel Station’s sun, and had demanded a new ambassador to take back to Teixcalaan, they had refused to explain what had happened to the previous one. Mahit was sure there had been a great deal of politics on the Lsel Council as to what—and who—to send back, and with what demands for information. But this she knew was true: she herself had been one of the few Stationers both old enough for the job and young enough not to have already been brought into an imago-line—and one of the fewer still within that group who had any of the appropriate aptitudes or training for diplomacy. Of those, Mahit had been the best. Her scores on the Imperial Examinations in Teixcalaanli language and literature had approached those of an imperial citizen, and she’d been proud of that—spent the half year since the exams imagining that she would come to the City, sometime in her middle age, once she was established, and collect experiences—attending whatever salons were open to noncitizens that season—gathering up information for whoever she’d share her memory with after she died.\n\nNow she’d get to the City, all right: more important than any Teixcalaanli examination, her scores on the imago-aptitudes had come up green, green, green for this match. Her imago would be Yskandr Aghavn, the previous Ambassador to Teixcalaan. Who was now somehow unsuitable to that empire—dead, or disgraced, or held captive if still alive. Mahit’s instructions from her government included determining precisely what had gone so wrong with him—but she still had his imago. He—or, at least, the last version of him available to give her, fifteen years out of date—was the closest thing Lsel could provide to a native guide to the Teixcalaanli court. Not for the first time, Mahit wondered whether or not there would be a Yskandr waiting for her in the flesh when she stepped outside. She was not sure which would be easier, having one—a disgraced ambassador? A competitor for her, but perhaps salvageable?—or not having one, which meant he had died without ever giving to any younger person what he had learned in his lifetime.\n\nThe imago-Yskandr in her head was hardly older than she was, which was both helpful in finding commonality and uncomfortable—most imagos were elders or victims of early-death accidents—but the last record of Yskandr’s knowledge and memory had been taken when he’d last returned to Lsel on leave from his post in Teixcalaan, only five years after he had first gone down to the City. It had been another decade and a half since then.\n\nSo he was young, and so was she, and whatever advantage to integration that might have granted the two of them was belied by how short a time they’d been together. Two weeks between the courier’s arrival and when Mahit learned that she’d be the next ambassador. Three more weeks for her and Yskandr to learn how to live together in the body that used to belong to her alone, under the supervision of the Station’s psychotherapists. A long, slow time on Ascension’s Red Harvest, traversing the sublight distances between the jumpgates that were scattered like jewels throughout Teixcalaanli space.\n\nThe seed-skiff peeled open like a ripe fruit. Mahit’s harness retracted. Taking hold of her luggage in both hands, she stepped onto the gate, and thus into Teixcalaan itself.\n\nThe skyport gate had an airy utilitarianism constructed of wear-resistant carpet and clearly marked signage between glass-and-steel-paneled walls. Standing in the center of the gate’s connecting tunnel, a precise halfway between the seed-skiff and the skyport proper, was a single Teixcalaanli imperial official in a perfectly cut cream suit. She was small: narrow at the shoulder and hip, much shorter than Mahit, and she wore her hair in a fishtail-braid queue of black that spilled over her left lapel. Her sleeves, wide like bells, shaded through flame-orange at the upper arm—<Information Ministry coloring,> Yskandr told Mahit—down to the deep red cuffs that were the privilege of the titled members of the court. Over her left eye she wore a cloudhook, a glass eyepiece full of the ceaseless obscuring flow of the imperial information network. Hers was sleekly decorative, much like the rest of her. Her large, dark eyes and thin cheekbones and mouth were more delicate than was fashionable on Teixcalaan, but by Mahit’s Stationer standards she was interesting, if not quite pretty. She touched her fingers together politely in front of her chest and inclined her head to Mahit.\n\nYskandr lifted Mahit’s own hands to make the same gesture—and Mahit dropped the two bags she’d been carrying on the floor with an embarrassing clatter. She was horrified. They hadn’t slipped like that since the first week they’d been together.\n\nFuck, she thought, and heard at the same moment Yskandr say <Fuck.> The doubling wasn’t reassuring.\n\nThe official’s carefully neutral expression did not change. She said, “Ambassador, I am Three Seagrass, asekreta and patrician second-class. It is my honor to welcome you into the Jewel of the World. I will be serving as your cultural liaison at the command of His Imperial Majesty Six Direction.” There was a long pause, and then the official gave a small sigh and went on: “Do you require some sort of assistance with your belongings?”\n\n“Three Seagrass” was an old-fashioned Teixcalaanli name: the numeral half was low value, and the noun half was the name of a plant, even if it was a plant Mahit hadn’t seen used in a name before. All of the noun parts of Teixcalaanli names were plants or tools or inanimate objects, but most of the plant ones were flowers. “Seagrass” was memorable. Asekreta meant she was not only Information Ministry, as her suit suggested, but a trained agent of rank, as well as holding the court title of patrician second-class: an aristocrat, but not a very important or rich one.\n\nMahit left her hands where Yskandr had put them, which was where they belonged no matter how angry she was at how they’d gotten there, and bowed over them. “Ambassador Mahit Dzmare of Lsel Station. At your service and that of His Majesty, may his reign be a radiant blaze upon the void.” Since this was her first official contact with a member of the Teixcalaanli court, she used the imperial honorific she’d picked carefully in consultation with Yskandr and the Council government on Lsel: “radiant blaze” was the epithet for the Emperor Twelve Solar-Flare in The Expansion History as Attributed to Pseudo-Thirteen River, the oldest account of imperial presence in Stationer space. Using it now was thus a sign of both Mahit’s erudition and her respect for Six Direction and his office; but “the void” carefully avoided any intimation of Teixcalaanli claim on parts of Stationer space which were not, in fact, space.\n\nWhether Three Seagrass was aware of the implications of reference was somewhat difficult to tell. She waited patiently while Mahit scooped up her luggage again, and then said, “Keep a tight grip on those. You are urgently awaited in the Judiciary concerning the previous ambassador, and you may need to greet all sorts of people along the way.”\n\nFine. Mahit wouldn’t underestimate Three Seagrass’s capability to be snide, nor her capability to be clever. She nodded, and when the other woman turned smartly and walked up the tunnel, she followed.\n\n<Don’t underestimate any of them,> Yskandr said. <A cultural liaison has been at court for half as long as you’ve been alive. She earned the post.>\n\nDon’t lecture me when you’ve just made me look like a flustered barbarian.\n\n<Do you want me to apologize?>\n\nAre you sorry?\n\nMahit could imagine his facial expression all too easily: arch, as calm as a Teixcalaanlitzlim, the lusher mouth she remembered from holographs of him dragging her own lips up and askew. <I wouldn’t want you to feel like a barbarian. You’ll get enough of that from them.>\n\nHe wasn’t sorry. It was marginally possible that he was embarrassed, but if he was, he wasn’t feeling it with her endocrine system.\n\n* * *\n\nYskandr got her through the next half hour. Mahit couldn’t even resent him for it. He behaved exactly like an imago ought to behave: a repository of instinctive and automatic skill that Mahit hadn’t had time to acquire for herself. He knew when to duck through doorways built for Teixcalaanlitzlim instead of Stationers; when to avert her eyes from the rising glare of the City reflected in the glass of the elevator that crawled down the outside of the skyport; how high to step to climb into Three Seagrass’s groundcar. He performed courtesy ritual like a native. After the incident with the luggage he was careful about actually moving Mahit’s hands, but she let him have charge of how long she maintained eye contact and with whom, the degree to which her head was inclined in greeting, all the little ways of signaling that she was less of an alien, less of a barbarian, something that might belong in the City. Protective coloration. Going native without ever having to be a native. She could feel curious eyes slide off of her and fixate on the far more interesting court dress of Three Seagrass, and wondered how much Yskandr had loved the City, to be this good at being in it.\n\nIn the groundcar, Three Seagrass asked, “Have you been within the world long?”\n\nMahit needed to stop thinking in any language but Teixcalaanli. What Three Seagrass meant was a standard bit of politesse small talk, a have you ever been to my country before, and Mahit had heard it like an existential question.\n\n“No,” she said, “but I have read the classics since I was a very small child, and I have thought often of the City.”\n\nThree Seagrass seemed to approve of this answer. “I wouldn’t want to bore you, Ambassador,” she said, “but if you’d like a brief and verbal tour of what we’re passing by, I’d be pleased to recite an appropriate poem.” She flicked a control button on her side of the car, and the windows faded to transparency.\n\n“I couldn’t be bored,” Mahit said honestly. Outside, the city was a blur of steel and pale stone, neon lights crawling up and down the glass walls of its skyscrapers. They were on one of the central ring roads, spiraling inward through municipal buildings toward the palace itself. Properly, it was more of a city-within-a-city than a palace. By statistics, it had several hundred thousand inhabitants, all of whom were responsible in some minute fashion for the functioning of the Empire, from the gardeners on up to Six Direction himself: each of them plugged into the information network that was guaranteed to imperial citizens, and every last one bathed in a constant flow of data that told them where to be, what to do, how the story of their day and week and epoch would go.\n\nThree Seagrass had an excellent voice. She was reciting The Buildings—a seventeen-thousand-line poem which described the City’s architecture. Mahit didn’t know the precise version she’d picked to declaim, but that might have been Mahit’s own fault. She had her own favorite narrative poems from the Teixcalaanli canon, and she’d memorized as many of them as she could in imitation of Teixcalaanli literati (and to pass the oral portions of the examinations), but The Buildings had always seemed too dull to bother with. It was different now, hearing Three Seagrass recite it as they passed the structures being described. She was a fluent orator, and she had enough command of the metrical scheme to add amusing and relevant original detail where improvisation was appropriate. Mahit folded her hands across her lap and watched the poetry going by through the glass windows of the groundcar.\n\nThis was the City, then, the Jewel of the World, the heart of the Empire: a collapse between narrative and perception, Three Seagrass making adjustments on the fly to the canonical Buildings when some building had changed. After some time she realized that Yskandr was reciting along with Three Seagrass, a dim whisper in the back of her mind, and also that she found the whisper reassuring. He knew this poem, and thus she knew it too, if she needed to know it. That was what imago-lines were for, after all: making sure useful memory was preserved, generation to generation.\n\nThey traveled through forty-five minutes and two traffic snarls before Three Seagrass concluded her stanza and stopped the groundcar at the base of a needlelike pillar of a building, quite near the center of the palace grounds. <Judiciary complex,> Yskandr said.\n\nGood sign or bad sign? Mahit asked him.\n\n<It depends. I wonder what I did.>\n\nSomething illegal. Come on, Yskandr, give me a general sense of the possibilities here. What would you do to get yourself thrown in jail?\n\nMahit got the impression of Yskandr sighing at her, but also the queasy sensation of someone else’s nervousness setting off her adrenal glands. <Mm. Sedition, mostly.>\n\nShe wished she could be sure he was joking.\n\nSurrounding the pillar of the Judiciary was a perimeter of grey-uniformed guards, clustered more closely at the door: a security checkpoint. The guards carried long, slim dark grey sticks rather than the energy weapons that the Teixcalaanli legions favored. Mahit had seen a lot of the latter on Ascension’s Red Harvest, but not these.\n\n<Shocksticks,> Yskandr said. <Electricity-based crowd control—these were not here when I was last here. They’re anti-riot gear, or at least they are in tabloid entertainments.>\n\nYou’re fifteen years out of date, Mahit thought. A lot might have changed—\n\n<This is the center of the palace. If they’re worried about riots at the Judiciary, something hasn’t changed, something is wrong. Now go find out what I did.>\n\nMahit wondered what had gone sufficiently wrong to create security theater at the door of the Judiciary, and if Yskandr had helped it go that wrong—felt prickles go up the back of her spine and down through her arms, the ulnar nerves crawling unpleasantly—and then had no time for more distressing reflection, as Three Seagrass was escorting her through. She offered up her thumbprints as well as Mahit’s, and stood with her eyes politely averted as a Teixcalaanli security guard patted chastely at the pockets of Mahit’s traveling jacket and her trousers. Her luggage was decorously placed in their custody, and she was promised that she could have it back on her way out.\n\nOnce the guard was done breaking all of Mahit’s personal space taboos, she advised Mahit to avoid wandering off without escort, as her identity was neither recorded on cloudhook nor otherwise authorized to be present within the Judiciary. Mahit raised an inquiring eyebrow at Three Seagrass.\n\n“There were questions of speed,” Three Seagrass said, proceeding briskly through a multiplicity of irising doors into a cool, slate-floored interior, toward the elevator bank. “Your registration and permission to move about the palace complex will of course be taken care of as soon as is possible.”\n\nMahit said, “I’ve been in transit more than a month, and there are questions of speed?”\n\n“We have been waiting for three months, Ambassador, since we sent for a new representative from the Station.”\n\n<I must have done something quite spectacular,> Yskandr said. <Down below are secret courts and interrogation chambers, or so the palace rumors always went.>\n\nThe elevator chimed in fourths. “And one more hour matters, after three months?”\n\nThree Seagrass gestured for Mahit to precede her into the elevator, which was a sort of answer, if not an informative one.\n\nThey descended.\n\nWaiting for them below was a chamber that could have been a courtroom or an operating theater: blue-metal floor, and amphitheater-style benches arrayed around a high table on which lay some large object covered in a sheet. Floodlights. Three Teixcalaanli strangers, all broad-cheekboned and broad-shouldered, one in a red cassock, one dressed identically to Three Seagrass in the orange-and-cream of the Information Ministry, and one in a dark grey suit that reminded Mahit of nothing so much as the metal sheen of the shocksticks. They stood around the table, arguing in low, rapid voices, and blocked Mahit’s view of whatever was lying on it.\n\n“I still would like to make my own examination, for my Ministry, before he’s returned,” said the Information Ministry courtier, annoyed.\n\n“There’s not a single good reason to just turn him back over to them,” the Teixcalaanlitzlim in red said, with some finality. “It won’t do us any good and might spark an incident—”\n\nDark Grey Suit disagreed. “Contrary to the opinions of your Ministry, ixplanatl, I am entirely certain that any incident they could induce wouldn’t be more trouble than an insect bite, and as easily soothed.”\n\n“Oh for fuck’s sake, argue later,” said the one from Information, “they’re here.”\n\nThe man in red turned toward them as they entered, as if he had been anticipating their arrival. The ceiling was a low dome. Mahit thought of a bubble of gas, trapped under the earth. Then she understood the shape on the table as a corpse.\n\nIt lay under a thin sheet drawn midway up its bare torso, hands resting on its chest, fingertips touching as if it was preparing to greet some afterlife. Its cheeks were sunken and its open eyes were filmed over with a hazy blue. The same color had infiltrated its lips and nailbeds. It looked like it had been dead a long time. Perhaps … three months.\n\nAs clearly as if he had been standing next to her, Mahit heard Yskandr say <I got old,> with wondering horror. She was shaking. Her heart raced, drowning out the sound of Three Seagrass introducing her. A dizzying rush, worse than falling toward the planet, panic out of nowhere. Not her panic: Yskandr’s, her imago flooding her with her own stress hormones, enough adrenaline to taste metallic. The mouth of the corpse was slack, but she could see the smile lines at its corners, feel on her own mouth how Yskandr’s muscles would have formed them over time.\n\n“As you see, Ambassador Dzmare,” said the man in red, whose name Mahit had completely failed to catch during the introductions, “a new ambassador was necessary. I apologize for preserving him in this fashion, but we did not want to disrespect any funereal processes which your people might prefer.”\n\nShe came closer. The corpse stayed dead, stayed still and limp and empty. <Fuck,> Yskandr said, a fizz of nauseating static. Mahit was horribly, helplessly sure she was going to throw up. <Oh, fuck, I can’t do this.>\n\nMahit thought (or Yskandr thought—she was having trouble keeping them apart, and this wasn’t how the integration was supposed to go, she was never supposed to be lost inside his biochemical panic response hijacking her own endocrine system) about how the only place that Yskandr existed now was inside her head. She’d considered that he was dead, when Teixcalaan had demanded a new ambassador, thought about it intellectually, planned for it, and yet—here he was—a corpse, a hollow rotting shell, and she was panicking because her imago was panicking and an emotion-spike was the easiest way to fuck up an integration that wasn’t finished, an emotion-spike would burn out all the tiny microcircuits in the machine in her mind and oh fuck he was dead and oh fuck I am dead and the blur, the nauseating blur of everything.\n\nYskandr, she tried, aiming for comfort and missing by a long distance.\n\n<Get closer,> he told her, <I need to see. I’m not sure—>\n\nHe moved them before she could decide to do what he asked. It was like she’d blacked out for the space of time it took to approach the corpse, blinked and was there, and this was going so very, very awry, and she couldn’t stop it—\n\n“We burn our dead,” she said, and didn’t know who to thank for the fact that she’d said it in the right language.\n\n“How interesting a custom,” said the courtier in dark grey. Mahit thought he was from the Judiciary itself; this was likely to be his morgue, even if it was the man in red who was the mortician.\n\nMahit smiled at him, too wide for her face and too uncontrolled for Yskandr’s, an expression that’d horrify any serene Teixcalaanlitzlim. “Afterward,” she said, searching for the correct vocabulary, a spar to cling to through the roiling waves of adrenaline, “we eat the ashes as a sacred thing. His children and successors first. If he had any.”\n\nThe courtier had the grace to blanch and the stubbornness to repeat himself. “How interesting a custom.”\n\n“What do you do with yours?” Mahit asked. She came nearer Yskandr’s corpse, drifting. Her mouth seemed to be under her control for the moment, but her feet belonged to Yskandr. “Excuse my inquiry. I am, after all, not a citizen.”\n\nThe man in red said, “Burial is common,” as if it was a question he answered every day. “Do you wish to examine the body, Ambassador?”\n\n“Is there some reason I should do so?” Mahit said, but she was already pulling down the sheet. Her fingers were sweating, slick on the fabric. Underneath, the corpse was naked, a fortyish man with all of his skin tinged that same blue at its most translucent points. An injectable preservative, all through him. The injection points were strikingly visible, holes surrounded by a halo of pale, swollen flesh—at the carotid, and in the ulnar veins of both arms. There was an extra injection site at the base of the corpse’s right thumb, distorting the shape of the hand. She found herself staring at it, in another one of those blanked-out moments—she’d been looking at his face, and now she was looking at his wrist, as if the imago needed to see every place his former body had been altered. Even if Mahit had wanted to claim her rights as his successor to the dust of his flesh—and she wasn’t sure she wanted to—she thought that it might be a very stupid idea to ingest whatever the man in red had filled him up with. Three months without rotting. She could taste bile in her throat, under the metallic endocrine cascade. Bodies should decompose, and be recycled.\n\nBut the Empire preserved everything, told the same stories over and over again; why not also preserve flesh instead of rendering it up for decent use?\n\nShe was touching the wrist, the imago tracing her fingertip over the injection site, and then further, into the palm, following the line of some scar. The flesh was rubbery, plasticky, too much give and not enough all at once—her Yskandr hadn’t gotten that scar yet; her Yskandr wasn’t dead yet—there was another one of those dizzying nauseous waves, the edges of her vision irising to fizz and sparks, and she thought again We are going to blow out all the circuitry, stop it—\n\n<I can’t,> Yskandr said again, an enormous negation inside her mind, an avulsion that felt like a spark gone to ground—and then he was gone.\n\nDead quiet. Not even the feeling of him watching through Mahit’s eyes. She felt gravityless, full of endorphins she hadn’t produced on purpose, and horribly alone. Her tongue was heavy. It tasted like aluminum.\n\nNothing like this had ever happened to her before.\n\n“How did he die?” she asked, and was amazed that she sounded entirely normal, entirely unfazed; asked for the sake of continuing to talk. None of the Teixcalaanli knew about imagos, none of them would even be able to understand what had just happened to her.\n\n“He choked on the air,” the man in red said, touching the corpse’s neck with a practiced span of two fingers. “His throat closed. It was very unfortunate; but the physiologies of noncitizens are often so different from ours.”\n\n“He ate something he was allergic to?” Mahit asked. This seemed absurd. She was shock-numb, and apparently Yskandr had died of anaphylaxis, and if she wasn’t careful she was going to have a hysterical laughing fit.\n\n“At dinner with the Minister for Science Ten Pearl, no less,” said the last courtier, the one from Information. This one looked like he’d climbed out of a classical Teixcalaanli painting: his features were unbelievably symmetrical: lush mouth, low forehead, perfectly hooked nose; eyes like deep brown pools. “You should have seen the newsfeeds afterward, Ambassador; it was quite the tabloid story.”\n\n“Twelve Azalea means no disrespect,” said Three Seagrass from where she stood by the door. “The news went no farther than the palace complex. It would be inappropriate for the general population.”\n\nMahit pulled the sheet back up to the corpse’s chin. It didn’t help. He was still there. “Was the story also inappropriate for the stations?” she asked. “The courier who asked for my service within the City was unnecessarily vague.”\n\nThree Seagrass shrugged, a minute shift of one shoulder. “Ambassador, while I am asekreta, not every asekreta is privy to the decisions of the Information Ministry as a whole.”\n\n“What would you like done with his body?” inquired the man in red. Mahit looked up at him; he was tall for a Teixcalaanlitzlim. His eyes, an unnervingly friendly green, were almost even with hers. She had no idea what to do with a corpse. She had never burnt anyone herself; she was too young. Her parents were both still living. And besides, what you did was you called the funeral manager and they handled it, preferably while someone you loved held your hand and cried with you over the mutual loss.\n\nShe had less idea what to do with this corpse. No one was going to cry over Yskandr, even her, and there weren’t any funeral managers in Teixcalaanli space who would know where to begin.\n\nShe managed, “Nothing yet,” and swallowed hard against the remains of the nausea. Her fingers felt electric, all prickle-shimmer where they had touched the dead man’s skin. “I will of course make arrangements once I am better acquainted with the facilities available. Until then, well, he’s not going to rot, is he?”\n\n“Only very slowly,” the man in red said.\n\n“Sir—” Mahit looked to Three Seagrass for help; she was a cultural liaison so she could damn well liaise—\n\n“Ixplanatl Four Lever,” Three Seagrass said obligingly. “Of the Science Ministry.”\n\n“Four Lever,” Mahit went on, dropping the man’s title—it meant “scientist,” in a very general sense, scientist-with-credentials—entirely on purpose, “when will the rot be noticeable? Another two months, perhaps?”\n\nFour Lever smiled enough to show off a sliver of teeth. “Two years, Ambassador.”\n\n“Excellent,” Mahit said. “That will be plenty of time.”\n\nFour Lever bowed over the triangular press of his fingertips, as if she’d given him an order. Mahit suspected she was being indulged. She’d take it. She had to. She needed space enough to think and she wasn’t going to get it here, in the bowels of the Judiciary with three courtiers and a ixplanatl morgue attendant all waiting for her to make some irrevocable error and end up like Yskandr had.\n\nBetrayed by his own physiology. After twenty years of living in the City, eating what the Teixcalaanlitzlim ate. Did she believe it?\n\nYskandr, she thought at the blank place where the imago ought to be, what did you get us into before you died?\n\nHe didn’t answer. Reaching for the blank spot made her feel like she was falling even though she knew her feet were steady on the floor.\n\n“I would like,” said Mahit to Three Seagrass, slow and even and in the correct language, trying to hide the vertigo and the fear, “to be registered as the legal Ambassador from the stations to Teixcalaan, and also to see to my luggage.” She wanted to get out of here. As fast as possible.\n\n“Naturally, Ambassador,” said Three Seagrass. “Ixplanatl. Twelve Azalea. Twenty-Nine Infograph. As ever, your company is a pleasure.”\n\n“As is yours, Three Seagrass,” said Twelve Azalea. “Enjoy the Ambassador.”\n\nThree Seagrass did that one-shoulder shrug again, as if nothing anyone had said could affect an asekreta of the court in a fashion that mattered. Mahit liked her, abruptly, and was aware that the liking was more of a desperate grasp at an ally than anything else. She was so alone, without the imago talking to her. Surely he’d come back in a moment. Once the shock was over. Once the emotion-spike had faded. It was fine. She was fine. She wasn’t even dizzy anymore.\n\n“Shall we, then?” she said.", "characters": [{"name": "Mahit Dzmare", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Yskandr Aghavn", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Three Seagrass", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Emperor Six Direction", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Emperor Twelve Solar-Flare", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Pseudo-Thirteen River", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Emperor Three Perigee", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Shrja Torel", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Ten Pearl", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Twelve Azalea", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Four Lever", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Twenty-Nine Infograph", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "classic", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0019}}
{"story_id": "the_call_of_the_wild_scene", "text": "from a dead standstill. Matthewson insisted that the phrase included\nbreaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow. A majority of\nthe men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor,\nwhereat the odds went up to three to one against Buck.\n\nThere were no takers. Not a man believed him capable of the feat.\nThornton had been hurried into the wager, heavy with doubt; and now\nthat he looked at the sled itself, the concrete fact, with the regular\nteam of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it, the more impossible\nthe task appeared. Matthewson waxed jubilant.\n\n“Three to one!” he proclaimed. “I’ll lay you another thousand at that\nfigure, Thornton. What d’ye say?”\n\nThornton’s doubt was strong in his face, but his fighting spirit was\naroused—the fighting spirit that soars above odds, fails to recognize\nthe impossible, and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle. He\ncalled Hans and Pete to him. Their sacks were slim, and with his own\nthe three partners could rake together only two hundred dollars. In the\nebb of their fortunes, this sum was their total capital; yet they laid\nit unhesitatingly against Matthewson’s six hundred.\n\nThe team of ten dogs was unhitched, and Buck, with his own harness, was\nput into the sled. He had caught the contagion of the excitement, and\nhe felt that in some way he must do a great thing for John Thornton.\nMurmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up. He was in\nperfect condition, without an ounce of superfluous flesh, and the one\nhundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit\nand virility. His furry coat shone with the sheen of silk. Down the\nneck and across the shoulders, his mane, in repose as it was, half\nbristled and seemed to lift with every movement, as though excess of\nvigor made each particular hair alive and active. The great breast and\nheavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of the\nbody, where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. Men\nfelt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron, and the odds went\ndown to two to one.\n\n“Gad, sir! Gad, sir!” stuttered a member of the latest dynasty, a king\nof the Skookum Benches. “I offer you eight hundred for him, sir, before\nthe test, sir; eight hundred just as he stands.”\n\nThornton shook his head and stepped to Buck’s side.\n\n“You must stand off from him,” Matthewson protested. “Free play and\nplenty of room.”\n\nThe crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of the gamblers\nvainly offering two to one. Everybody acknowledged Buck a magnificent\nanimal, but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their\neyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings.\n\nThornton knelt down by Buck’s side. He took his head in his two hands\nand rested cheek on cheek. He did not playfully shake him, as was his\nwont, or murmur soft love curses; but he whispered in his ear. “As you\nlove me, Buck. As you love me,” was what he whispered. Buck whined with\nsuppressed eagerness.\n\nThe crowd was watching curiously. The affair was growing mysterious. It\nseemed like a conjuration. As Thornton got to his feet, Buck seized his\nmittened hand between his jaws, pressing in with his teeth and\nreleasing slowly, half-reluctantly. It was the answer, in terms, not of\nspeech, but of love. Thornton stepped well back.\n\n“Now, Buck,” he said.\n\nBuck tightened the traces, then slacked them for a matter of several\ninches. It was the way he had learned.\n\n“Gee!” Thornton’s voice rang out, sharp in the tense silence.\n\nBuck swung to the right, ending the movement in a plunge that took up\nthe slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty\npounds. The load quivered, and from under the runners arose a crisp\ncrackling.\n\n“Haw!” Thornton commanded.\n\nBuck duplicated the manœuvre, this time to the left. The crackling\nturned into a snapping, the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and\ngrating several inches to the side. The sled was broken out. Men were\nholding their breaths, intensely unconscious of the fact.\n\n“Now, MUSH!”\n\nThornton’s command cracked out like a pistol-shot. Buck threw himself\nforward, tightening the traces with a jarring lunge. His whole body was\ngathered compactly together in the tremendous effort, the muscles\nwrithing and knotting like live things under the silky fur. His great\nchest was low to the ground, his head forward and down, while his feet\nwere flying like mad, the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in\nparallel grooves. The sled swayed and trembled, half-started forward.\nOne of his feet slipped, and one man groaned aloud. Then the sled\nlurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks, though it\nnever really came to a dead stop again...half an inch...an inch... two\ninches... The jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained\nmomentum, he caught them up, till it was moving steadily along.\n\nMen gasped and began to breathe again, unaware that for a moment they\nhad ceased to breathe. Thornton was running behind, encouraging Buck\nwith short, cheery words. The distance had been measured off, and as he\nneared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards,\na cheer began to grow and grow, which burst into a roar as he passed\nthe firewood and halted at command. Every man was tearing himself\nloose, even Matthewson. Hats and mittens were flying in the air. Men\nwere shaking hands, it did not matter with whom, and bubbling over in a\ngeneral incoherent babel.\n\nBut Thornton fell on his knees beside Buck. Head was against head, and\nhe was shaking him back and forth. Those who hurried up heard him\ncursing Buck, and he cursed him long and fervently, and softly and\nlovingly.\n\n“Gad, sir! Gad, sir!” spluttered the Skookum Bench king. “I’ll give you\na thousand for him, sir, a thousand, sir—twelve hundred, sir.”\n\nThornton rose to his feet. His eyes were wet. The tears were streaming\nfrankly down his cheeks. “Sir,” he said to the Skookum Bench king, “no,\nsir. You can go to hell, sir. It’s the best I can do for you, sir.”\n\nBuck seized Thornton’s hand in his teeth. Thornton shook him back and\nforth. As though animated by a common impulse, the onlookers drew back\nto a respectful distance; nor were they again indiscreet enough to\ninterrupt.", "characters": [{"name": "Buck", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Hans", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "John", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Matthewson", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Pete", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Thornton", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "classic", "source": "validation", "book": "The Call of the Wild", "entity_density": 0.037}}
{"story_id": "jane_eyre_scene", "text": "Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up. Within the arch, the\nbulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise\nchosen, was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table,\nlay open a large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr.\nRochester’s cloak, and holding a book in her hand. Somebody, unseen,\nrang the bell merrily; then Adèle (who had insisted on being one of her\nguardian’s party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents\nof a basket of flowers she carried on her arm. Then appeared the\nmagnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her\nhead, and a wreath of roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr.\nRochester, and together they drew near the table. They knelt; while\nMrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up their\nstations behind them. A ceremony followed, in dumb show, in which it\nwas easy to recognise the pantomime of a marriage. At its termination,\nColonel Dent and his party consulted in whispers for two minutes, then\nthe Colonel called out—\n\n“Bride!” Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.\n\nA considerable interval elapsed before it again rose. Its second rising\ndisplayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last. The\ndrawing-room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the\ndining-room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two\nback within the room, appeared a large marble basin, which I recognised\nas an ornament of the conservatory—where it usually stood, surrounded\nby exotics, and tenanted by gold fish—and whence it must have been\ntransported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.\n\nSeated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr.\nRochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head. His dark eyes\nand swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he\nlooked the very model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the\nbowstring. Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram. She, too, was\nattired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the\nwaist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her\nbeautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of\nsupporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head. Both her cast of\nform and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the\nidea of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was\ndoubtless the character she intended to represent.\n\nShe approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher;\nshe again lifted it to her head. The personage on the well-brink now\nseemed to accost her; to make some request:—“She hasted, let down her\npitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.” From the bosom of his robe\nhe then produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets\nand earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid\nthe treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her\nlooks and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and\nthe rings in her ears. It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were\nwanting.\n\nThe divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they\ncould not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.\nColonel Dent, their spokesman, demanded “the tableau of the whole;”\nwhereupon the curtain again descended.\n\nOn its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed;\nthe rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and\ncoarse drapery. The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a\ndeal table and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very\ndim light proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all\nextinguished.\n\nAmidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on\nhis knees, and his eyes bent on the ground. I knew Mr. Rochester;\nthough the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose\nfrom one arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a\nscuffle), the desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling\nhair might well have disguised him. As he moved, a chain clanked; to\nhis wrists were attached fetters.\n\n“Bridewell!” exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.", "characters": [{"name": "Adèle", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Amy", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Dent", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Colonel Dent"]}, {"name": "Eshton", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Ingram", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Louisa", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Miss Ingram", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Mrs. Dent", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Rochester", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "George Lynn", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Sir George Lynn"]}], "metadata": {"genre": "classic", "source": "validation", "book": "Jane Eyre", "entity_density": 0.0271}}

{"story_id": "jane_eyre_scene_2", "text": "“What are they, madam?” inquired Mr. Rochester aloud.\n\n“I will tell you in your private ear,” replied she, wagging her turban\nthree times with portentous significancy.\n\n“But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now.”\n\n“Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I.”\n\n“Oh, don’t refer him to me, mama! I have just one word to say of the\nwhole tribe; they are a nuisance. Not that I ever suffered much from\nthem; I took care to turn the tables. What tricks Theodore and I used\nto play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts! Mary\nwas always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit. The best fun was\nwith Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose\nand low-spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and\nMrs. Grey was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her. But\npoor Madame Joubert! I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had\ndriven her to extremities—spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter,\ntossed our books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the\nruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons. Theodore, do you remember\nthose merry days?”\n\n“Yaas, to be sure I do,” drawled Lord Ingram; “and the poor old stick\nused to cry out, ‘Oh you villains childs!’—and then we sermonised her on\nthe presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,\nwhen she was herself so ignorant.”\n\n“We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or\npersecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining—the parson in the pip,\nas we used to call him. He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling\nin love with each other—at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised\nsundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of ‘la\nbelle passion,’ and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of\nour discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our\ndead-weights from the house. Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an\ninkling of the business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.\nDid you not, my lady-mother?”\n\n“Certainly, my best. And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a\nthousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should\nnever be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly—”\n\n“Oh, gracious, mama! Spare us the enumeration! _Au reste_, we all know\nthem: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and\nconsequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached—mutual alliance\nand reliance; confidence thence resulting—insolence accompanying—mutiny\nand general blow-up. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?”\n\n“My lily-flower, you are right now, as always.”\n\n“Then no more need be said: change the subject.”\n\nAmy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her\nsoft, infantine tone: “Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but\nshe was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her\nout. She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?”\n\n“No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her\nworkbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,\nshe would give us anything we asked for.”\n\n“I suppose, now,” said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, “we\nshall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in\norder to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a\nnew topic. Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?”\n\n“Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other.”\n\n“Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward. Signior Eduardo, are\nyou in voice to-night?”\n\n“Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be.”\n\n“Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your\nlungs and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal\nservice.”\n\n“Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?”\n\n“A fig for Rizzio!” cried she, tossing her head with all its curls, as\nshe moved to the piano. “It is my opinion the fiddler David must have\nbeen an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my\nmind a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history\nmay say what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just\nthe sort of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to\ngift with my hand.”\n\n“Gentlemen, you hear! Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?” cried\nMr. Rochester.\n\n“I should say the preference lies with you,” responded Colonel Dent.\n\n“On my honour, I am much obliged to you,” was the reply.\n\nMiss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,\nspreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a\nbrilliant prelude; talking meantime. She appeared to be on her high\nhorse to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite\nnot only the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was\nevidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring\nindeed.\n\n“Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!” exclaimed she,\nrattling away at the instrument. “Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a\nstep beyond papa’s park gates: nor to go even so far without mama’s\npermission and guardianship! Creatures so absorbed in care about their\npretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man\nhad anything to do with beauty! As if loveliness were not the special\nprerogative of woman—her legitimate appanage and heritage!

Such should be my device, were I a man.”\n\n“Whenever I marry,” she continued after a pause which none interrupted,\n“I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me. I\nwill suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided\nhomage: his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he\nsees in his mirror.

{"story_id": "mistborn_final_empire_scene_001", "text": "Vin walked in the indicated direction, passing through a filthy dining room, floor scattered with tracked-in ash. As she approached the far wall, she could see a splintery wooden door set in the room’s corner. A man seated by the door caught her eyes, nodded slightly, and pushed the door open. Vin passed quickly into the small room beyond.\n\n“Vin, my dear!” Breeze said, lounging at a table near the center of the room. “Welcome! How was Fellise?”\n\nVin shrugged, taking a seat at the table.\n\n“Ah,” Breeze said. “I’d almost forgotten what a fascinating conversationalist you are. Wine?”\n\nVin shook her head.\n\n“Well, I would certainly like some.” Breeze wore one of his extravagant suits, dueling cane resting across his lap. The chamber was only lit by a single lantern, but it was far cleaner than the room outside. Of the four other men in the room, Vin recognized only one—an apprentice from Clubs’s shop. The two by the door were obviously guards. The last man appeared to be a regular skaa worker—complete with blackened jacket and ashen face. His self-confident air, however, proved that he was a member of the underground. Probably one of Yeden’s rebels.\n\nBreeze held up his cup, tapping its side with his fingernail. The rebel regarded it darkly.\n\n“Right now,” Breeze said, “you’re wondering if I’m using Allomancy on you. Perhaps I am, perhaps I am not. Does it matter? I’m here by your leader’s invitation, and he ordered you to see that I was made comfortable. And, I assure you, a cup of wine in my hand is absolutely necessary for my comfort.”\n\nThe skaa man waited for a moment, then snatched the cup and stalked away, grumbling under his breath about foolish costs and wasted resources.\n\nBreeze raised an eyebrow, turning to Vin. He seemed quite pleased with himself.\n\n“So, did you Push him?” she asked.\n\nBreeze shook his head. “Waste of brass. Did Kelsier tell you why he asked you to come here today?”\n\n“He told me to watch you,” Vin said, a bit annoyed at being handed off to Breeze. “He said he didn’t have time to train me in all the metals.”\n\n“Well,” Breeze said, “let us begin, then. First, you must understand that Soothing is about more than just Allomancy. It’s about the delicate and noble art of manipulation.”\n\n“Noble indeed,” Vin said.\n\n“Ah, you sound like one of them,” Breeze said.\n\n“Them who?”\n\n“Them everyone else,” Breeze said. “You saw how that skaa gentleman treated me? People don’t like us, my dear. The idea of someone who can play with their emotions, who can ‘mystically’ get them to do certain things, makes them uncomfortable. What they do not realize—and what you must realize—is that manipulating others is something that all people do. In fact, manipulation is at the core of our social interaction.”\n\nHe settled back, raising his dueling cane and gesturing with it slightly as he spoke. “Think about it. What is a man doing when he seeks the affection of a young lady? Why, he is trying to manipulate her to regard him favorably. What happens when two old friends sit down for a drink? They tell stories, trying to impress each other. Life as a human being is about posturing and influence. This isn’t a bad thing—in fact, we depend upon it. These interactions teach us how to respond to others.”\n\nHe paused, pointing at Vin with the cane. “The difference between Soothers and regular people is that we are aware of what we’re doing. We also have a slight … advantage. But, is it really that much more ‘powerful’ than having a charismatic personality or a fine set of teeth? I think not.”\n\nVin paused.\n\n“Besides,” Breeze added, “as I mentioned, a good Soother must be skilled far beyond his ability to use Allomancy. Allomancy can’t let you read minds or even emotions—in a way, you’re as blind as anyone else. You fire off pulses of emotions, targeted at a single person or in an area, and your subjects will have their emotions altered—hopefully producing the effect that you wished. However, great Soothers are those who can successfully use their eyes and instincts to know how a person is feeling before they get Soothed.”\n\n“What does it matter how they’re feeling?” Vin said, trying to cover her annoyance. “You’re just going to Soothe them anyway, right? So, when you’re done, they’ll feel how you want them to.”\n\nBreeze sighed, shaking his head. “What would you say if you knew I’d Soothed you on three separate occasions during our conversation?”\n\nVin paused. “When?” she demanded.\n\n“Does it matter?” Breeze asked. “This is the lesson you must learn, my dear. If you can’t read how someone is feeling, then you’ll never have a subtle touch with emotional Allomancy. Push someone too hard, and even the most blind of skaa will realize that they’re being manipulated somehow. Touch too softly, and you won’t produce a noticeable effect—other, more powerful emotions will still rule your subject.”\n\nBreeze shook his head. “It’s all about understanding people,” he continued. “You have to read how someone is feeling, change that feeling by nudging it in the proper direction, then channel their newfound emotional state to your advantage. That, my dear, is the challenge in what we do! It is difficult, but for those who can do it well …”\n\nThe door opened, and the sullen skaa man returned, bearing an entire bottle of wine. He put it and a cup on the table before Breeze, then went over to stand on the other side of the room, beside peepholes looking into the dining room.\n\n“There are vast rewards,” Breeze said with a quiet smile. He winked at her, then poured some wine.\n\nVin wasn’t certain what to think. Breeze’s opinion seemed cruel. Yet, Reen had trained her well. If she didn’t have power over this thing, others would gain power over her through it. She started burning copper—as Kelsier had taught her—to shield herself from further manipulations on Breeze’s part.\n\nThe door opened again, and a familiar vest-wearing form tromped in. “Hey, Vin,” Ham said with a friendly wave. He walked over to the table, eyeing the wine. “Breeze, you know that the rebellion doesn’t have the money for that kind of thing.”\n\n“Kelsier will reimburse them,” Breeze said with a dismissive wave. “I simply cannot work with a dry throat. How is the area?”\n\n“Secure,” Ham said. “But I’ve got Tineyes on the corners just in case. Your bolt-exit is behind that hatch in the corner.”\n\nBreeze nodded, and Ham turned, looking at Clubs’s apprentice. “You Smoking back there, Cobble?”\n\nThe boy nodded.\n\n“Good lad,” Ham said. “That’s everything, then. Now we just have to wait for Kell’s speech.”\n\nBreeze checked his pocket watch. “He’s not scheduled for another few minutes. Shall I have someone fetch you a cup?”\n\n“I’ll pass,” Ham said.\n\nBreeze shrugged, sipping his wine.\n\nThere was a moment of silence. Finally, Ham spoke. “So …”\n\n“No,” Breeze interrupted.\n\n“But—”\n\n“Whatever it is, we don’t want to hear about it.”\n\nHam gave the Soother a flat stare. “You can’t Push me into complacence, Breeze.”\n\nBreeze rolled his eyes, taking a drink.\n\n“What?” Vin asked. “What were you going to say?”\n\n“Don’t encourage him, my dear,” Breeze said.\n\nVin frowned. She glanced at Ham, who smiled.\n\nBreeze sighed. “Just leave me out of it. I’m not in the mood for one of Ham’s inane debates.”\n\n“Ignore him,” Ham said eagerly, pulling his chair a little bit closer to Vin. “So, I’ve been wondering. By overthrowing the Final Empire are we doing something good, or are we doing something bad?”\n\nVin paused. “Does it matter?”\n\nHam looked taken aback, but Breeze chuckled. “Well answered,” the Soother said.\n\nHam glared at Breeze, then turned back to Vin. “Of course it matters.”\n\n“Well,” Vin said, “I guess we’re doing something good. The Final Empire has oppressed the skaa for centuries.”\n\n“Right,” Ham said. “But, there’s a problem. The Lord Ruler is God, right?”\n\nVin shrugged. “Does it matter?”\n\nHam glared at her.\n\nShe rolled her eyes. “All right. The Ministry claims that he is God.”\n\n“Actually,” Breeze noted, “the Lord Ruler is only a piece of God. He is the Sliver of Infinity—not omniscient or omnipresent, but an independent section of a consciousness that is.”\n\nHam sighed. “I thought you didn’t want to be involved.”\n\n“Just making certain everyone has their facts correct,” Breeze said lightly.\n\n“Anyway,” Ham said. “God is the creator of all things, right? He is the force that dictates the laws of the universe, and is therefore the ultimate source of ethics. He is absolute morality.”\n\nVin blinked.\n\n“You see the dilemma?” Ham asked.\n\n“I see an idiot,” Breeze mumbled.\n\n“I’m confused,” Vin said. “What’s the problem?”\n\n“We claim to be doing good,” Ham said. “But, the Lord Ruler—as God—defines what is good. So, by opposing him we’re actually evil. But, since he’s doing the wrong thing, does evil actually count as good in this case?”\n\nVin frowned.\n\n“Well?” Ham asked.\n\n“I think you gave me a headache,” Vin said.\n\n“I warned you,” Breeze noted.\n\nHam sighed. “But, don’t you think it’s worth thinking about?”\n\n“I’m not sure.”\n\n“I am,” Breeze said.\n\nHam shook his head. “No one around here likes to have decent, intelligent discussions.”", "characters": [{"name": "Vin", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Breeze", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Ham", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Cobble", "role": "MINOR"}, {"name": "Clubs", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Kelsier", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0487}}
{"story_id": "assassins_apprentice_scene_002", "text": "He has become his father's favorite, Chade growled. Shrewd has done nothing but spoil him since the Queen died. He tries to buy the boy's heart with gifts, now that his mother is no longer around to claim his allegiance. And Regal takes full advantage. He speaks only what the old man loves to hear. And Shrewd gives him too much rein. He lets him wander about, squandering coin on useless visits to Farrow and Tilth, where his mother's people fill Regal full of ideas of his self-importance. The boy should be kept at home and made to give some account for how he spends his time. And the King's money. What he spends gallivanting about would have outfitted a warship. And then, suddenly annoyed: That's too hot! You'll lose it, fish it out quickly.\n\nBut his words came too late, for the crucible cracked with a noise like breaking ice and its contents filled Chade's tower room with an acrid smoke that brought all lessons and talk to an end for that night.\n\nI was not soon summoned again. My other lessons went on, but I missed Chade as the weeks passed and he did not call for me. I knew he was not displeased with me, but only preoccupied. When, idle one day, I pushed my awareness toward him, I felt only secrecy and discordance. And a wallop to the back of my head when Burrich caught me at it.\n\nStop it, he hissed, and ignored my studied look of shocked innocence. He glanced about the stall I was mucking out as if he expected to find a dog or cat lurking.\n\nThere's nothing here! he exclaimed.\n\nJust manure and straw, I agreed, rubbing the back of my head.\n\nThen what were you doing?\n\nDaydreaming, I muttered. That was all.\n\nYou can't fool me, Fitz, he growled. And I won't have it. Not in my stables. You won't pervert my beasts that way. Or degrade Chivalry's blood. Mind what I've told you.\n\nI clenched my jaws and lowered my eyes and kept on working. After a time I heard him sigh and move away. I went on raking, inwardly seething and resolving never to let Burrich come up on me unawares again.\n\nThe rest of that summer was such a whirlpool of events that I find it hard to recall their progression. Overnight, the very feeling of the air seemed to change. When I went into town, all of the talk was of fortifications and readiness. Only two more towns were Forged that summer, but it seemed a hundred, for the stories of it were repeated and enlarged from lip to lip.\n\nUntil it seems as if that is all folk talk about anymore, Molly complained to me.\n\nWe were walking on Long Beach, in the light of the summer evening sun. The wind off the water was a welcome bit of cool after a muggy day. Burrich had been called away to Springmouth to see if he could figure out why all the cattle there were developing huge hide sores. It meant no morning lessons for me, but many, many more chores with the horses and hounds in his absence, especially as Cob had gone to Turlake with Regal, to manage his horses and hounds for a summer hunt.\n\nBut the opposite weight of the balance was that my evenings were less supervised, and I had more time to visit town.\n\nMy evening walks with Molly were almost a routine now. Her father's health was failing and he scarcely needed to drink to fall into an early and deep sleep each night. Molly would pack a bit of cheese and sausage for us, or a small loaf and some smoked fish, and we would take a basket and a bottle of cheap wine and walk out down the beach to the breakwater rocks. There we would sit on the rocks as they gave up the last heat of the day, and Molly would tell me about her day's work and the day's gossip and I would listen. Sometimes our elbows bumped as we walked.\n\nSara, the butcher's daughter, told me that she positively yearns for winter to come. The winds and ice will beat the Red-Ships back to their own shores for a bit, and give us a rest from fear, she says. But then Kelty up and says that maybe we'll be able to stop fearing more Forging, but that we'll still have to fear the Forged folk that are loose in our land. Rumor says that some from Forge have left there, now that there's nothing left for them to steal, and that they travel about as bandits, robbing travelers.\n\nI doubt it. More than likely it's other folk doing the robbing, but trying to pass themselves off as Forged folk to send revenge looking elsewhere. Forged folk don't have enough kinship left in them to be a band of anything, I contradicted her lazily. I was looking out across the bay, my eyes almost closed against the glare of the sun on the water. I didn't have to look at Molly to feel her there beside me. It was an interesting tension, one I didn't fully understand. She was sixteen, and I about fourteen, and those two years loomed between us like an insurmountable wall. Yet she always made time for me and seemed to enjoy my company. She seemed as aware of me as I was of her. But if I quested toward her at all, she would draw back, halting to shake a pebble from her shoe or suddenly speaking of her father's illness and how much he needed her. Yet if I drew my sensings back from that tension, she became uncertain and shyer of speech, and would try to look at my face and the set of my mouth and eyes. I didn't understand it, but it was as if we held a string taut between us. But now I heard an edge of annoyance in her speech.\n\nOh, I see. And you know so much of Forged folk, do you, more than those who have been robbed by them?\n\nHer tart words caught me off balance and it was a moment or two before I could speak. Molly knew nothing of Chade and me, let alone of my side trip with him to Forge. To her, I was an errand boy for the keep, working for the stablemaster when I wasn't fetching for the scribe. I couldn't betray my firsthand knowledge, let alone how I had sensed what Forging was.\n\nI've heard the talk of the guards, when they're around the stables and kitchens at night. Soldiers like them have seen much of all kinds of folk, and they're the ones who say that the Forged ones have no friendships, no family, no kinship ties at all left. Still, I suppose if one of them took to robbing travelers, others would copy him, and it would be almost the same as a band of robbers.\n\nPerhaps. She seemed mollified by my comments. Look, let's climb up there to eat.\n\nUp there was a shelf on the cliff's edge rather than the breakwater. But I assented with a nod, and the next handful of minutes were spent in getting ourselves and our basket up there. It required more arduous climbing than our earlier expeditions had. I caught myself watching to see how Molly would manage her skirts, and taking opportunities to catch at her arm to balance her, or take her hand to help her up a steep bit while she kept hold of the basket. In a flash of insight I knew that Molly's suggestion that we climb had been her way of manipulating the situation to cause this. We finally gained the ledge and sat, looking out over the water with her basket between us, and I was savoring my awareness of her awareness of me. It reminded me of the clubs of the Springfest jugglers as they handed them back and forth, back and forth, more and more and faster and faster. The silence lasted until a time when one of us had to speak. I looked at her, but she looked aside. She looked into the basket and said, Oh, dandelion wine? I thought that wasn't any good until after midwinter.", "characters": [{"name": "Fitz", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Chade", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Burrich", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Molly", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Shrewd", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Regal", "role": "ANTAGONIST"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.043}}
{"story_id": "magician_scene_003", "text": "Dolgan puffed on his pipe, a friendly smile splitting his beard. “And how do you intend to stop me, Your Grace? Surely not by force?”\n\nBorric shook his head. “No, of course not. But to go would be the sheerest folly.”\n\nKulgan and Arutha exchanged questioning looks. Pug paid little attention, being lost in a cold, numb world. In spite of having just awakened, he felt ready for sleep again, welcoming its warm, soft relief.\n\nBorric told them, “This mad dwarf means to return to the mines.”\n\nBefore Kulgan and Arutha could voice a protest, Dolgan said, “I know it is only a slim hope, but if the boy has eluded the foul spirit, he’ll be wandering lost and alone. There are tunnels down there that have never known the tread of a dwarf’s foot, let alone a boy’s. Once down a passage, I have no trouble making my way back, but Tomas has no such natural sense. If I can find his trail, I can find him. If he is to have any chance of escaping the mines, he’ll be needing my guidance. I’ll bring home the boy if he lives, on this you have the word of Dolgan Tagarson, chief of village Caldara. I could not rest in my long hall this winter if I did not try.”\n\nPug was roused from his lethargy by the dwarf’s words. “Do you think you can find him, Dolgan?”\n\n“If any can, I can,” he said. He leaned close to Pug. “Do not get your hopes too high, for it is unlikely that Tomas eluded the wraith. I would do you a disservice if I said otherwise, boy.” Seeing the tears brimming in Pug’s eyes again, he quickly added, “But if there is a way, I shall find it.”\n\nPug nodded, seeking a middle path between desolation and renewed hope. He understood the admonition, but still could not give up the faint flicker of comfort Dolgan’s undertaking would provide.\n\nDolgan crossed over to where his shield and ax lay and picked them up. “When the dawn comes, quickly follow the trail down the hills through the woodlands. While not the Green Heart, this place has menace aplenty for so small a band. If you lose your way, head due east. You’ll find your way to the road to Bordon. From there it is a matter of three days’ walk. May the gods protect you.”\n\nBorric nodded, and Kulgan walked over to where the dwarf made ready to leave. He handed Dolgan a pouch. “I can get more tabac in the town, friend dwarf. Please take this.”\n\nDolgan took it and smiled at Kulgan. “Thank you, magician. I am in your debt.”\n\nBorric came to stand before the dwarf and place a hand on his shoulder. “It is we who are in your debt, Dolgan. If you come to Crydee, we will have that meal you were promised. That, and more. May good fortune go with you.”\n\n“Thank you, Your Lordship. I’ll look forward to it.” Without another word, Dolgan walked into the blackness of Mac Mordain Cadal.\n\nDolgan stopped by the dead mules, pausing only long enough to pick up food, water, and a lantern. The dwarf needed no light to make his way underground—his people had long ago adapted other senses for the darkness. But, he thought, it will increase the chances of finding Tomas if the boy can see the light, no matter the risk of attracting unwelcome attention. Assuming he is still alive, he added grimly.\n\nEntering the tunnel where he had last seen Tomas, Dolgan searched about for signs of the boy’s passing. The dust was thin, but here and there he could make out a slight disturbance, perhaps a footprint. Following, the dwarf came to even dustier passages, where the boy’s footfalls were clearly marked. Hurrying, he followed them.\n\nDolgan came back to the same cavern, after a few minutes, and cursed.\n\nHe felt little hope of finding the boy’s tracks again among all the disturbance caused by the fight with the wraith. Pausing briefly, he set out to examine each tunnel leading out of the cavern for signs. After an hour he found a single footprint heading away from the cavern, through a tunnel to the right of where he had entered the first time. Moving up it, he found several more prints, set wide apart, and decided the boy must have been running. Hurrying on, he saw more tracks, as the passage became dustier.\n\nDolgan came to the cavern on the lake and nearly lost the trail again, until he saw the tunnel near the edge of the landing. He slogged through the water, pulling himself up into the passage, and saw Tomas’s tracks. His faint lantern light was insufficient to illuminate the crystals in the cavern. But even if it had, he would not have paused to admire the sight, so intent was he on finding the boy.\n\nDownward he followed, never resting. He knew that Tomas had long before outdistanced the wraith. There were signs that most of his journey was at a slower pace: footprints in the dust showed he had been walking, and the cold campfire showed he had stopped. But there were other terrors besides the wraith down here, just as dreadful.\n\nDolgan again lost the trail in the last cavern, finding it only when he spied the ledge above where the tracks ended. He had difficulty climbing to it, but when he did, he saw the blackened spot where the boy had snuffed out his torch. Here Tomas must have rested. Dolgan looked around the empty cavern. The air did not move this deep below the mountains. Even the dwarf, who was used to such things, found this an unnerving place. He looked down at the black mark on the ledge. But how long did Tomas stay, and where did he go?\n\nDolgan saw the hole in the wall and, since no tracks led away from the ledge, decided that was the way Tomas must have gone. He climbed through and followed the passage until it came to a larger one, heading downward, into the bowels of the mountain.\n\nDolgan followed what seemed to be a group of tracks, as if a band of men had come this way. Tomas’s tracks were mixed in, and he was worried, for the boy could have been along this way before or after the others, or could have been with them. If the boy was held prisoner by someone, then Dolgan knew every moment was critical.\n\nThe tunnel wound downward and soon changed into a hall fashioned from great stone blocks fitted closely together and polished smooth. In all his years he had never seen its like. The passage leveled out, and Dolgan walked along quietly. The tracks had vanished, for the stone was hard and free of dust. High overhead, Dolgan could make out the first of several crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling by chains. They could be lowered by means of a pulley, so the candles might be lit. The sound of his boots echoed hollowly off the high ceiling.\n\nAt the far end of the passage he spied large doors, fashioned from wood, with bands of iron and a great lock. They were ajar, and light could be seen coming through.\n\nWithout a sound, Dolgan crept close to the doors and peered in. He gaped at what he saw, his shield and ax coming up instinctively.\n\nSitting on a pile of gold coins, and gems the size of a man’s fist, was Tomas, eating what looked to be a fish. Opposite him crouched a figure that caused Dolgan to doubt his eyes.\n\nA head the size of a small wagon rested on the floor. Shield-size scales of a deep golden color covered it, and the long, supple neck led back to a huge body extending into the gloom of the giant hall. Enormous wings were folded across its back, their drooping tips touching the floor. Two pointed ears sat atop its head, separated by a delicate-looking crest, flecked with silver. Its long muzzle was set in a wolflike grin, showing fangs as long as broadswords, and a long forked tongue flicked out for a moment.\n\nDolgan fought down the overwhelming and rare urge to run, for Tomas was sitting, and to all appearances sharing a meal, with the dwarven folk’s most feared hereditary enemy: a great dragon. He stepped forward, and his boots clacked on the stone floor.\n\nTomas turned at the sound, and the dragon’s great head came up. Giant ruby eyes regarded the small intruder. Tomas jumped to his feet, an expression of joy upon his face. “Dolgan!” He scrambled down from the pile of wealth and rushed to the dwarf.\n\nThe dragon’s voice rumbled through the great hall, echoing like thunder through a valley. “Welcome, dwarf. Thy friend hath told me that thou wouldst not forsake him.”\n\nTomas stood before the dwarf, asking a dozen questions, while Dolgan’s senses reeled. Behind the boy, the Prince of all dragons sat quietly observing the exchange, and the dwarf was having trouble maintaining the equanimity that was normally his. Making little sense of Tomas’s questions, Dolgan gently pushed him to one side to better see the dragon. “I came alone,” he said softly to the boy. “The others were loath to leave the search to me, but they had to press on, so vital was the mission.”\n\nTomas said, “I understand.”\n\n“What manner of wizardry is this?” asked Dolgan softly.\n\nThe dragon chuckled, and the room rumbled with the sound. “Come into my home, dwarf, and I will tell thee.” The great dragon’s head returned to the floor, his eyes still resting above Dolgan’s head. The dwarf approached slowly, shield and ax unconsciously at the ready. The dragon laughed, a deep, echoing sound, like water cascading down a canyon. “Stay thy hand, small warrior, I’ll not harm thee or thy friend.”\n\nDolgan let his shield down and hung his ax on his belt. He looked around and saw that they were standing in a vast hall, fashioned out of the living rock of the mountain. On all its walls could be seen large tapestries and banners, faded and torn; something about their look set Dolgan’s teeth on edge, for they were as alien as they were ancient—no creature he knew of, human, elf, or goblin fashioned those pennants. More of the giant crystal chandeliers hung from timbers across the ceiling. At the far end of the hall, a throne could be seen on a dais, and long tables with chairs for many diners stood before it. Upon the tables were flagons of crystal and plates of gold. And all was covered with the dust of ages.\n\nElsewhere in the hall lay piles of wealth: gold, gems, crowns, silver, rich armor, bolts of rare cloth, and carved chests of precious woods, fitted with inlaid enamels of great craft.\n\nDolgan sat upon a lifetime’s riches of gold, absently moving it around to make as comfortable a seat as was possible. Tomas sat next to him as the dwarf pulled out his pipe. He didn’t show it, but he felt the need to calm himself, and his pipe always soothed his nerves. He lit a taper from his lantern and struck it to his pipe. The dragon watched him, then said, “Canst thou now breathe fire and smoke, dwarf? Art thou the new dragon? Hath ever a dragon been so small?”\n\nDolgan shook his head. “’Tis but my pipe.” He explained the use of tabac.\n\nThe dragon said, “This is a strange thing, but thine are a strange folk, in truth.”\n\nDolgan cocked a brow at this but said nothing. “Tomas, how did you come to this place?”\n\nTomas seemed unmindful of the dragon, and Dolgan found this reassuring. If the great beast had wished to harm them, he could have done so with little effort. Dragons were undisputedly the mightiest creatures on Midkemia. And this was the mightiest dragon Dolgan had heard of, half again the size of those he had fought in his youth.\n\nTomas finished the fish he had been eating and said, “I wandered for a long time and came to a place where I could sleep.”\n\n“Aye, I found it.”\n\n“I awoke at the sound of something and found tracks that led here.”\n\n“Those I saw also. I was afraid you had been taken.”\n\n“I wasn’t. It was a party of goblins and a few Dark Brothers, coming to this place. They were very concerned about what was ahead and didn’t pay attention to what was behind, so I could follow fairly close.”\n\n“That was a dangerous thing to do.”\n\n“I know, but I was desperate for a way out. I thought they might lead me to the surface, and I could wait while they went on ahead, then slip out. If I could get out of the mines, I could have headed north toward your village.”\n\n“A bold plan, Tomas,” said Dolgan, an approving look in his eyes.\n\n“They came to this place, and I followed.”\n\n“What happened to them?”\n\nThe dragon spoke. “I sent them far away, dwarf, for they were not company I would choose.”\n\n“Sent them away? How?”", "characters": [{"name": "Dolgan", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Tomas", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Borric", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Kulgan", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Arutha", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Pug", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Dragon", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0505}}
{"story_id": "red_rising_scene_004", "text": "BAD THINGS\n\nMatteo is a tall wisp of a Pink with long limbs and a lean, beautiful face. He is a slave. Or was a slave for carnal pleasures. Yet he walks like a water lord. Beauty in his step. Manners and grace in the wave of his hand. He has a penchant for wearing gloves and sniffing at even the smallest bit of dirt. Body maintenance has been his life’s purpose. So he doesn’t find it strange when he helps me apply a hair follicle killer to my arms, legs, torso, and privates. But I do. When we’re done, we’re both cursing—me from the sting, him from the punch I threw at his shoulder. I accidentally dislocated it just by punching it. I still don’t know my own strength. And they do make their Pinks fragile. If he is the rose, I am the thorns.\n\n“Bald as a toddler, you frenetic little baby,” Matteo sighs as properly as one can say such a thing. “Just as the newest Luna fashion requires. Now, with a bit of eyebrow sculpting—oh, how your brows are like fungus-nibbling caterpillars—and nose-hair eradication, cuticle readjustment, teeth whitening on those slick new chompers—which, if I may say, are yellow as mustard dappled with dandelions … tell me, have you ever brushed your new teeth?—and blackhead removal (which shall be like probing for helium-3), toner adjustment, and melatonin injections, and you’ll be prim and rose proper–ish.”\n\nI snort at the foolishness of it all. “I already look like a Gold.”\n\n“You look like a Bronze! A fool’s Gold! One of the lowbred bastards who looks more khaki than Gold. You must be perfect.”\n\n“You’re a bloodydamn odd lark, Matteo.”\n\nHe smacks me. “Mind yourself! A Gold would rather die than use that slithering mineslang. ‘Gorydamn’ or ‘gory’; and ‘slag’ instead of ‘squab.’ Every time you say ‘bloody’ or ‘bloodydamn,’ I will smack not your gob, but your mouth. And if you say ‘squab’ or ‘gob,’ I will kick you in the scrotum—which I do know my way around—as I will do if you do not get rid of that horrible accent. You sound like you were born in a gorydamn dumpster.”\n\nHe frowns and sets his hands on his narrow hips.\n\n“And then we’ll have to teach you manners. And culture, culture, goodman.”\n\n“I have manners.”\n\n“By the maker, we are so, so going to have to make you forswear that brogue as well as the cursing.”\n\nHe pokes me as he lists out my flaws.\n\n“Might try adopting some manners of your own, buttboy,” I growl.\n\nHe pulls off one of my gloves and slaps me across the face and takes a bottle in hand and holds it to my throat. I laugh.\n\n“You’ll have to get your Helldiver reflexes back soon to go with that gawky new body.”\n\nI eye the bottle.\n\n“Going to poke me to death?”\n\n“It is a polyenne sword, goodman. A razor, in other words. One moment it is soft as hair, but with an organic impulse, it turns harder than diamond. It is the only thing that will cut through a pulseShield. One moment a whip, the next moment a perfect sword. It is the weapon of a gentleman. A Gold. For any other Color to carry it is death.”\n\n“It is a bottle, you daft—”\n\nHe jams me in the throat so that I gag.\n\n“And it was your manners that forced me to draw my razor and challenge you, thereby precipitously ending your impudent life. You may have fought with fists for honor in that hovel you called home. You were a bug then. An ant. An Aureate fights with a blade at the slightest provocation. They have honor the likes of which you know nothing about. Your honor was personal; theirs is personal, familial, and planetary. That is all. They fight for higher stakes, and they do not forgive when the bloodletting is done. Least of all the Peerless Scarred. Manners, goodman. Manners will protect you until you can protect yourself from my shampoo bottle.”\n\n“Matteo …,” I say, rubbing my throat.\n\n“Yes?” he sighs.\n\n“What is shampoo?”\n\nAnother stint in Mickey’s carving room might have been preferable to Matteo’s tutelage. At least Mickey was afraid of me.\n\nThe next morning Dancer tries to rename me.\n\n“You will be the son of a relatively unknown family from the far asteroid clusters. Soon, the family will be dead in a shipping accident. You will be the lone survivor and the only heir to their debts and poor status. His name, your name, will be Caius au Andromedus.”\n\n“Slag that,” I reply. “I will be Darrow or I will be nothing.”\n\nHe scratches his head. “Darrow is an … odd name.”\n\n“You have made me give up the hair Father gave me, the eyes Mother left me, the Color I was born to, so I will keep the name they granted me, and you can make it work.”\n\n“I liked it better when you didn’t act like a Gold,” Dancer grumbles.\n\n“Now, the key to dining like an Aureate is to eat slowly,” Matteo says as we sit together at a table in the penthouse where Dancer first showed me the world. “You will find yourself subjected to many Trimalchian feasts. On such occasions, there will be seven courses—appetizer, soup, fish, meat, salad, dessert, and libations.”\n\nHe gestures to a small tray laden with silverware and explains the various methods for eating with each.\n\nThen he tells me, “If you must urinate or defecate during the meal, you hold it in. Controlling one’s bodily functions is expected of an Aureate.”\n\n“So these namby-pamby Goldbrows aren’t allowed to shit? And when they do, I wonder, does it come out gold?”\n\nMatteo slaps my cheek with his glove. “If you’re so eager to see red again, let your tongue slip in their presence, goodman, and they’ll be happy to remind you what color all men bleed. Manners and control! You have neither.” He shakes his head. “Now, tell me what this fork is used for.”\n\nI want to tell him it’s used for picking his arse, but I sigh and give him the correct answer. “Fish, but only if the bones are still in the dish.”\n\n“And how much of this fish are you to eat?”\n\n“All of it,” I guess.\n\n“No!” he cries. “Were you even listening?” His small hands clutch his hair and he takes a deep breath. “Must I remind you? There are Bronzies. There are Golds. And there are Pixies.”\n\nHe leaves the rest for me to finish.\n\n“Pixies have no self-control,” I remember aloud. “They take in all the treats of power, but do pissall to merit them. They are born and they chase pleasure. Righto?”\n\n“Prime, not righto. Now what is expected of a Gold? Of a Peerless Scarred?”\n\n“Perfection.”\n\n“Which means?”\n\nMy voice is cold as I mimic a Gold’s accent. “It means control, goodman. Self-control. I am permitted to indulge in vices so long as I never permit them to usurp control. If there is a key to understanding Aureates, it is found in understanding control in all its forms. Eat the fish, leave twenty percent to indicate its deliciousness did not overpower my resolve or make slaves of my taste-buds.”\n\n“So you were listening after all.”\n\nDancer finds me the next day as I practice my Aureate accent in the penthouse’s holomirror. I can see a three-dimensional depiction of my head in front of me. The teeth move strangely, catching my tongue as I try to roll my words. I am still becoming used to my body, even months after the last of the surgeries. My teeth are larger than I initially thought them. It also doesn’t help that the Goldbrows speak as though they’ve had golden shovels stuck up their bloodydamn stinkholes. So I find it easier to speak like one if I see that I am one. The arrogance comes easier.\n\n“Soften your r’s,” Dancer tells me. He sits attentively as I read from a datapad. “Pretend as though there is an h in front of each one.” His burner reminds me of home and I remember how ArchGovernor Augustus seemed in Lykos. I remember the man’s serenity. His patient condescension. His smirk. “Elongate the l’s.”\n\n“Is that all the strength you have?” I say into the mirror.\n\n“Perfect,” Dancer praises with a humorous shiver. He claps his good hand on his knee.\n\n“Soon I’ll be dreaming like I’m a bloodydamn Goldbrow too,” I say in disgust.\n\n“You shouldn’t say ‘bloodydamn.’ Say ‘gory’ or ‘gorydamn’ instead.”", "characters": [{"name": "Darrow", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Matteo", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Dancer", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Mickey", "role": "MINOR"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0362}}
{"story_id": "dune_scene_005", "text": "Hawat pulled up a chair across from Paul, sat down facing the door. He did it pointedly, leaned back and studied the room. It struck him as an odd place suddenly, a stranger-place with most of its hardware already gone off to Arrakis. A training table remained, and a fencing mirror with its crystal prisms quiescent, the target dummy beside it patched and padded, looking like an ancient foot soldier maimed and battered in the wars.\n\n\t\tThere stand I, Hawat thought.\n\n\t\t“Thufir, what’re you thinking?” Paul asked.\n\n\t\tHawat looked at the boy. “I was thinking we’ll all be out of here soon and likely never see the place again.”\n\n\t\t“Does that make you sad?”\n\n\t\t“Sad? Nonsense! Parting with friends is a sadness. A place is only a place.” He glanced at the charts on the table. “And Arrakis is just another place.”\n\n\t\t“Did my father send you up to test me?”\n\n\t\tHawat scowled—the boy had such observing ways about him. He nodded. “You’re thinking it’d have been nicer if he’d come up himself, but you must know how busy he is. He’ll be along later.”\n\n\t\t“I’ve been studying about the storms on Arrakis.”\n\n\t\t“The storms. I see.”\n\n\t\t“They sound pretty bad.”\n\n\t\t“That’s too cautious a word: bad. Those storms build up across six or seven thousand kilometers of flatlands, feed on anything that can give them a push—coriolis force, other storms, anything that has an ounce of energy in it. They can blow up to seven hundred kilometers an hour, loaded with everything loose that’s in their way—sand, dust, everything. They can eat flesh off bones and etch the bones to slivers.”\n\n\t\t“Why don’t they have weather control?”\n\n\t\t“Arrakis has special problems, costs are higher, and there’d be maintenance and the like. The Guild wants a dreadful high price for satellite control and your father’s House isn’t one of the big rich ones, lad. You know that.”\n\n\t\t“Have you ever seen the Fremen?”\n\n\t\tThe lad’s mind is darting all over today, Hawat thought.\n\n\t\t“Like as not I have seen them,” he said. “There’s little to tell them from the folk of the graben and sink. They all wear those great flowing robes. And they stink to heaven in any closed space. It’s from those suits they wear—call them ‘stillsuits’—that reclaim the body’s own water.”\n\n\t\tPaul swallowed, suddenly aware of the moisture in his mouth, remembering a dream of thirst. That people could want so for water they had to recycle their body moisture struck him with a feeling of desolation. “Water’s precious there,” he said.\n\n\t\tHawat nodded, thinking: Perhaps I’m doing it, getting across to him the importance of this planet as an enemy. It’s madness to go in there without that caution in our minds.\n\n\t\tPaul looked up at the skylight, aware that it had begun to rain. He saw the spreading wetness on the gray meta-glass. “Water,” he said.\n\n\t\t“You’ll learn a great concern for water,” Hawat said. “As the Duke’s son you’ll never want for it, but you’ll see the pressures of thirst all around you.”\n\n\t\tPaul wet his lips with his tongue, thinking back to the day a week ago and the ordeal with the Reverend Mother. She, too, had said something about water starvation.\n\n\t\t“You’ll learn about the funeral plains,” she’d said, “about the wilderness that is empty, the wasteland where nothing lives except the spice and the sandworms. You’ll stain your eyepits to reduce the sun glare. Shelter will mean a hollow out of the wind and hidden from view. You’ll ride upon your own two feet without ’thopter or groundcar or mount.”\n\n\t\tAnd Paul had been caught more by her tone—singsong and wavering—than by her words.\n\n\t\t“When you live upon Arrakis,” she had said, “khala, the land is empty. The moons will be your friends, the sun your enemy.”\n\n\t\tPaul had sensed his mother come up beside him away from her post guarding the door. She had looked at the Reverend Mother and asked: “Do you see no hope, Your Reverence?”\n\n\t\t“Not for the father.” And the old woman had waved Jessica to silence, looked down at Paul. “Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four things….” She held up four big-knuckled fingers. “…the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these are as nothing….” She closed her fingers into a fist. “…without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!”\n\n\t\tA week had passed since that day with the Reverend Mother. Her words were only now beginning to come into full register. Now, sitting in the training room with Thufir Hawat, Paul felt a sharp pang of fear. He looked across at the Mentat’s puzzled frown.\n\n\t\t“Where were you woolgathering that time?” Hawat asked.\n\n\t\t“Did you meet the Reverend Mother?”\n\n\t\t“That Truthsayer witch from the Imperium?” Hawat’s eyes quickened with interest. “I met her.”\n\n\t\t“She….” Paul hesitated, found that he couldn’t tell Hawat about the ordeal. The inhibitions went deep.\n\n\t\t“Yes? What did she?”\n\n\t\tPaul took two deep breaths. “She said a thing.” He closed his eyes, calling up the words, and when he spoke his voice unconsciously took on some of the old woman’s tone: “‘You, Paul Atreides, descendant of kings, son of a Duke, you must learn to rule. It’s something none of your ancestors learned.’” Paul opened his eyes, said: “That made me angry and I said my father rules an entire planet. And she said, ‘He’s losing it.’ And I said my father was getting a richer planet. And she said, ‘He’ll lose that one, too.’ And I wanted to run and warn my father, but she said he’d already been warned—by you, by Mother, by many people.”\n\n\t\t“True enough,” Hawat muttered.\n\n\t\t“Then why’re we going?” Paul demanded.\n\n\t\t“Because the Emperor ordered it. And because there’s hope in spite of what that witch-spy said. What else spouted from this ancient fountain of wisdom?”\n\n\t\tPaul looked down at his right hand clenched into a fist beneath the table. Slowly, he willed the muscles to relax. She put some kind of hold on me, he thought. How?\n\n\t\t“She asked me to tell her what it is to rule,” Paul said. “And I said that one commands. And she said I had some unlearning to do.”\n\n\t\tShe hit a mark there right enough, Hawat thought. He nodded for Paul to continue.\n\n\t\t“She said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel. She said he must lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men.”\n\n\t\t“How’d she figure your father attracted men like Duncan and Gurney?” Hawat asked.\n\n\t\tPaul shrugged. “Then she said a good ruler has to learn his world’s language, that it’s different for every world. And I thought she meant they didn’t speak Galach on Arrakis, but she said that wasn’t it at all. She said she meant the language of the rocks and growing things, the language you don’t hear just with your ears. And I said that’s what Dr. Yueh calls the Mystery of Life.”\n\n\t\tHawat chuckled. “How’d that sit with her?”\n\n\t\t“I think she got mad. She said the mystery of life isn’t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience. So I quoted the First Law of Mentat at her: ‘A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.’ That seemed to satisfy her.”\n\n\t\tHe seems to be getting over it, Hawat thought, but that old witch frightened him. Why did she do it?\n\n\t\t“Thufir,” Paul said, “will Arrakis be as bad as she said?”\n\n\t\t“Nothing could be that bad,” Hawat said and forced a smile. “Take those Fremen, for example, the renegade people of the desert. By first-approximation analysis, I can tell you there’re many, many more of them than the Imperium suspects. People live there, lad: a great many people, and….” Hawat put a sinewy finger beside his eye. “…they hate Harkonnens with a bloody passion. You must not breathe a word of this, lad. I tell you only as your father’s helper.”\n\n\t\t“My father has told me of Salusa Secundus,” Paul said. “Do you know, Thufir, it sounds much like Arrakis…perhaps not quite as bad, but much like it.”\n\n\t\t“We do not really know of Salusa Secundus today,” Hawat said. “Only what it was like long ago…mostly. But what is known—you’re right on that score.”\n\n\t\t“Will the Fremen help us?”\n\n\t\t“It’s a possibility.” Hawat stood up. “I leave today for Arrakis. Meanwhile, you take care of yourself for an old man who’s fond of you, heh? Come around here like the good lad and sit facing the door. It’s not that I think there’s any danger in the castle; it’s just a habit I want you to form.”\n\n\t\tPaul got to his feet, moved around the table. “You’re going today?”\n\n\t\t“Today it is, and you’ll be following tomorrow. Next time we meet it’ll be on the soil of your new world.” He gripped Paul’s right arm at the bicep. “Keep your knife arm free, heh? And your shield at full charge.” He released the arm, patted Paul’s shoulder, whirled and strode quickly to the door.\n\n\t\t“Thufir!” Paul called.\n\n\t\tHawat turned, standing in the open doorway.\n\n\t\t“Don’t sit with your back to any doors,” Paul said.\n\n\t\tA grin spread across the seamed old face. “That I won’t, lad. Depend on it.” And he was gone, shutting the door softly behind.", "characters": [{"name": "Paul", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Hawat", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Reverend Mother", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Jessica", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Duncan", "role": "MINOR"}, {"name": "Gurney", "role": "MINOR"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0465}}
{"story_id": "lies_of_locke_lamora_scene_006", "text": "\"Twelve gods, no\" the man whispered. He licked his lips, stared at Locke for a second or two,and then gave a brief nod. \"What do I do?\"\n\"Just follow me,\" said Locke. \"We'll make this easy and quick.\"\n\"I have about twenty minutes,\" said the waiter. \"And then ] need to be back on the floor\"\n\"When I'm finished,\" said Locke, \"that won't matter. PU let Meraggio know you've helped us both; you'll be off the hook.\"\n \n\"Uh,okay. Where are we going?\"\n\"Just around the corner here... We need an inn.\"\nThe Welcoming Shade was just around the block from Meraggio's Countinghouse. It was tolerably clean, cheap, and devoid of luxuriesthe sort of place that hosted couriers, scholars, scribes, attendants, and lesser functionaries rather than the better classes of businessfolk. The place was a two-story square, built around an open central space in the fashion of a Therin Throne villa. At the center of this courtyard was a tall olive tree with leaves that rustled pleasantly in the sunlight.\n\"One room,\" said Locke, \"with a window, just for the day.\" He set coins down on the counter. The innkeeper scurried out, key in hand, to show Locke and the waiter to a second-story room marked \"9.\"\nChamber nine had a pair of folding cots, an oiled-paper window, a small closet, and nothing else. The master of the Welcoming Shade bowed as he left, and kept his mouth shut. Like most Camorri innkeepers, any questions he might have had about his customers or their business tended to vanish when silver hit the counter.\n\"What's your name?\" Locke drew the room's door closed and shot the bolt.\n\"Benjavier,\" said the waiter. \"You're, ah, sure..,this is going to work out like you say it is?\"\nIn response, Locke drew out his coin purse and set it in Benjavier's hand. \"There's two more full crowns in there, above and beyond what you'll receive. Plus quite a bit of gold and silver. My word's as good as my moneyand you can keep that purse, here, as an assurance until I return.\"\n\"Gods,\" said Ben Javier. \"This is.., this is all so very odd, I wonder what I've done to deserve such incredible fortune?\"\n\"Most men do nothing to deserve what the gods throw their way,\" said Locke. \"Shall we be about our business?\"\n\"Yes, yes.\" Benjavier untied his apron and tossed it to Locke; he then began to work on his jacket and breeches. Locke slipped off his velvet cap.\n\"[ say, gray hairyou don't look your age, in the face, I mean.\"\n\"I've always been blessed with youthful lines,\" said Locke. \"It's been of some benefit, in the duke's service. I'll need your shoes, as wellmine would look rather out of place beneath that finery.\"\nWorking quickly, the two men removed and traded clothing until Locke stood in the center of the room, fully garbed as a Meraggio's waiter, with the maroon apron tied at his waist. Benjavier lounged on one of the\n \nsleeping pallets in his undertunic and breechclout, tossing the bag of jingling coins from hand to hand.\n\"Well? How do I look?\"\n\"You look right smart,\" said Benjavier. \"You'll blend right in.\"\n\"Good, You, for your part, look right wealthy. Just wait here with the door locked; I'll be back soon enough. I'll knock exactly five times, savvy?\"\n\"Sounds fine.\"\nLocke closed the door behind him, hurried down the stairs, across the courtyard, and back out into the street. He took the long way around to return to Meraggio's, so he could enter via the front and avoid the guard at the service entrance.\n\"You're not supposed to come and go this way\" said the directory guard when Locke burst into the foyer, red-cheeked and sweating.\n\"I know, sorry.\" Locke waved his blank roll of parchment at the man. \"I was sent out to fetch this for one of the lawscribes; one of the private gallery members, I should say,\"\n\"Oh,sorry. Don't let us keep you; go right through.\"\nLocke entered into the crowd on the floor of Meraggio's for the third time, gratified by how few lingering looks he received as he hurried on his way. He wove deftly between well-dressed men and women and ducked out of the path of waiters bearing covered silver trayshe was careful to give these men a friendly, familiar nod as they passed. In moments, he found what he was looking fortwo guards lounging against a back wall, their heads bent together in conversation.\n\"Look lively, gentlemen,\" said Locke as he stepped up before them; either one of them had to outweigh him by at least five stone. \"Either of you lads know a man named Benjavier? He's one of my fellow waiters.\"\n\"I know him by sight\" said one of the guards.\n\"He's in a heap of shit,\" said Locke. \"He's over at the Welcoming Shade, and he's just fucked up one of Meraggio's tests. I'm to fetch him back; I'm supposed to grab you two for help.\"\n\"One of Meraggio's tests?\"\n\"You know,\" said Locke. \"Like he did to Willa\"\n\"Oh, her. That clerk in the public section. Benjavier, you say? What's he done?\"\n\"Sold the old man out, and Meraggio's not pleased. We really should do this sooner rather than later\"\n\"Uh... sure, sure.\"\n\"Out the side, through the service entrance.1\"\n \nLocke positioned himself very carefully to make it seem as though he was confidently walking along beside the guards when in fact he was following their lead through the kitchens, the service corridors, and finally the receiving room. He slipped into the lead, and the two guards were on his heels as he stepped out into the alley, waving casually at the lounging guard. The man showed no signs of recognizing him; Locke had seen dozens of waiters already with his own eyes. No doubt a stranger could pass as one for quite some time, and he didn't even need quite some time.\nA few minutes later, he rapped sharply on the door of chamber nine at the Welcoming Shade, five times. Benjavier opened the door a crack, only to have it shoved open all the way by a stiff arm from Locke, who called up some of the manner he'd used when he'd lectured Don Salvara as a \"Midnighter.\"\n\"It was a loyalty test, Benjavier,\" said Locke as he stalked into the room, his eyes cold, \"A loyalty test, And you fucked it up. Take him and hold him, lads.\"\nThe two guards moved to restrain the half-naked waiter, who stared at them in shock \"But... but I didn't... but you saidw\n\"Your job is to serve Meraggio's customers and sustain Master Meraggio's trust. My job is to find and deal with men that don't sustain his trust. You sold me your gods-damned uniform.\" Locke swept white iron crowns and the coin purse up from the bed; he dropped the loose coins into the leather bag as he spoke.\"I could have been a thief. I could have been an assassin. And you would have let me walk right up to Master Meraggio, with the perfect disguise.\"\n\"But you... oh, gods, you can't be serious, this can't be happening!\"\n\"Do these men look less than serious? I'm sorry, Benjavier. It's nothing personal, but you made a very poor decision.\" Locke held the door open. \"Right, out with him. Back to Meraggio's, quick as you can.\"\nBenjavier kicked out, snarling and crying, \"No, no, you can't, I've been loyal all my\" Locke grabbed him by the chin and stared into his eyes.\n\"If you fight back,\" said Locke, \"if you kick or scream or continue to raise a gods-damned fuss, this matter will go beyond Meraggio's, do you understand? We will bring in the watch. We will have you hauled to the Palace of Patience in irons. Master Meraggio has many friends at the Palace of Patience. Your case might fall between the cracks for a few months. You might get to sit in a spider cage and ponder your wrongdoing until the rains of winter start to fall. Do ] make myself clear?\"\n\"Yes,\" sobbed Benjavier, \"Oh,gods, I'm sorry, I'm sorry....\"\n \n\"It's not me you need to apologize to. Now, like I said, let's get him back quickly. Master Meraggio's going to want a word with him.\"\nLocke led the way back to the countinghouse, with Benjavier sobbing but quiescent, Locke strolled into the receiving room, right past the startled service-door guard, and bellowed, \"Clear this room. Now?\nA few of the lounging waiters looked as though they might offer argument, but the sight of Benjavier, half-dressed and firmly held by the two guards, seemed to convince them that something was deeply amiss. They scuttled from the room, and Locke turned to the guards.\n\"Hold him here,\" said Locke. 'I'm going to fetch Master Meraggio; we'll return in a few moments, This room is to stay clear until we return. Let the waiters take their ease somewhere else.\"\n\"Hey, what's going on?\" The service-door guard poked his head into the receiving room.\n\"If you value your job,\" said Locke, \"keep your eyes out there in that alley, and don't let anyone else in, Meraggio's going to be down here soon, and he's going to be in a mood, so it'd be best not to catch his attention.\"\n\"I think he's right, Laval,\" said one of the guards holding Benjavier.\n\"Uh.. .sure, sure.\"The service-door guard vanished.\n\"As for you,\" said Locke, stepping close to Benjavier, \"like I said, it's nothing personal. Can ] give you a bit of advice? Don't play games. You can't lie to Meraggio. None of us could, on our best day. Just confess, straight out. Be totally honest. Do you understand?\"\n\"Yes,\" sniffed Benjavier. \"Yes, please, I'll do anything\t\"\n\"You don't need to do anything. But if you hope for Master Meraggio to be at all lenient or sympathetic, then by the gods, you rucking confess and you do it in a hurry. No games, remember?\"\n\"O-okay, yes, anything.. \"\n\"I shall return very shortly,\" said Locke, and he spun on his heel and made for the door. As he left the receiving room, he allowed himself a brief smirk of pleasure; the guards pinning Benjavier now looked almost as frightened of him as the waiter did. It was strange, how readily authority could be conjured with nothing but a bit of strutting jackassery. He made his way through the service passages and kitchens, and back out onto the public floor.\n\"I say,\" said Locke to the first guard he came across, ^is Master Meraggio in the members' galleries?\" Locke waved his blank rolled parchment as though it were pressing business.\n \n\"Far as I know,\" said the guard, \"I think he's up on the third level, taking reports.\"\n\"Many thanks.\"\nLocke climbed the wide black iron stairs that led up to the first members'gallery, nodding at the pair of guards at its base. His uniform seemed to be a sufficient guarantee of gallery privileges, but he kept the parchment clutched visibly in both hands, as an added assurance. He scanned the first-floor galleries, found no sign of his quarry, and continued upward.\nHe found Ciancana Meraggio on the third floor, just as the guard had indicated. Meraggio stood staring out at the public gallery,abstractly, as he listened to a pair of finnickers behind him read from wax tablets figures that meant very little to Locke. Meraggio didn't seem to keep a bodyguard near his person; apparently he felt safe enough within the bounds of his commercial kingdom. So much the better, Locke stepped right up beside him, relishing the arrogance of the gesture, and stood waiting to be noticed.\nThe finnickers and several nearby gallery members started muttering to themselves; after a few seconds Meraggio turned and let the full power of his storm-lantern glare rest on Locke. It took only a moment for that glare to shift from irritation to suspicion.\n\"You\" said Meraggio, \"do nor work for me.\"\n\"I bring greetings from Capa Raza of Camorr\" said Locke, in a quiet and respectful voice. \"I have a very serious matter to bring to your attention, Master Meraggio.\"\nThe master of the countinghouse stared at him, then removed his optics and tucked them in a coat pocket, \"So it's true, then. I'd heard Barsavi\nhad gone the way of all flesh\tAnd now your master sends a lackey. How\nkind of him. What's his business?\"\n\"His business is rather congruent with yours, Master Meraggio. I'm here to save your life.\"\nMeraggio snorted. \"My life is hardly in danger, my improperly dressed friend. This is my house, and any guard here would cut your balls off with two words from me. If I WCTC you, I'd start explaining where you got that uniform.\"\n\"I purchased it,\" said Locke, \"from one of your waiters, a man by the name of Benjavier. I knew he was tractable, because he's already in on the plot against your life.\"\n\"Ben? Gods damn itwhat proof have you?\"\n \n\"I have several of your guards holding him down by your service entrance, rather half-dressed.\"\n\"What do you mean you have several of my guards holding him? Who the hell do you think you are?\"\n\"Capa Raza has given me the job of saving your life, Master Meraggio. I mean exactly what I said. And as for who I am, I happen to be your savior.\"\n\"My guards and my waiters\"\n\"Are not reliable,\" hissed Locke. \"Are you blind? I didn't purchase this at a secondhand clothier; I walked right in through your service entrance, offered a few crowns, and your man Benjavier was out of his uniform like that,\" Locke snapped his fingers, \"Your guard at the service door slipped me in for much lessjust a solon. Your men are not made of stone, Master Meraggio; you presume much concerning their fidelity\"\nMeraggio stared at him, color rising in his cheeks; he looked as though he was about to strike Locke. Instead, he coughed and held out his hands, palms up,\n\"Tell me what you came to tell me,\" said Meraggio. \"I'll take my own counsel from there.\"\n\"Your fin nickers are crowding me. Dismiss them and give us a bit of privacy.\"\n\"Don't tell me what to do in my own\"\n\"I will tell you what to do, gods damn it,\" Locke spat. \"I am youT fucking bodyguardjMister Meraggio. You are in deadly danger; minutes count, You already know of at least one compromised waiter and one lax guard; how much longer are you going to prevent me from keeping you alive?\"\n\"Why is Capa Raza so concerned for my safety?\"\n\"Your personal comfort likely means nothing to him,\" said Locke. \"The safety of the Meraggio, however, is of paramount importance. An assassination contract has been taken out against you, by Verrari commercial interests who wish to see Camorr's fortunes diminished. Raza has been in power for four days; your assassination would shake the city to its foundations. The Spider and the city watch would tear Raza's people apart looking for answers, He simply cannot allow harm to come to you. He must keep this city stable, as surely as the duke must.\"\n\"And how does your master know all of this?\"\n\"A gift from the gods,\" said Locke. \"Letters were intercepted while my master's agents were pursuing an unrelated matter. Please dismiss your finnickers,\"\n \nMeraggio pondered for a few seconds, then grunted and waved his attendants away with an irritated wrist-flick. They backed off, wide-eyed.\n\"Someone very nasty is after you,\" said Locke. \"It's a crossbow job; the assassin is Lashani. Supposedly, his weapons have been altered by a Karthani Bondsmage. He's slippery as all hell, and he almost always hits the mark. Be flattered; we believe his fee is ten thousand crowns.\"\n\"This is a great deal to swallow, Master,..\"\n\"My name isn't important\" said Locke. \"Come with me, down to the receiving room behind the kitchens. You can talk to Benjavier yourself.\"\n\"The receiving room, behind the kitchens?\" Meraggio frowned deeply. \"As yet, I have no reason to believe that you yourself might not be trying to Jure me there for mischief,\"\n\"Master Meraggio,\" said Locke, \"you are wearing silk and cotton, not chain mail. I have had you at dagger-reach for several minutes now. If my master wished you dead, your entrails would be staining the carpet. You don't have to thank meyou don't even have to like mebut for the love of the gods, please accept that I have been ordered to guard you, and one does not refuse the orders of the Capa of Camorr.\"\n\"Hmmm. A point. Is he as formidable a man as Barsavi was, this Capa Raza?\"\n\"Barsavi died weeping at his feet,\" said Locke. \"Barsavi and all of his children. Draw your own conclusions.\"\nMeraggio slipped his optics back onto his nose, adjusted his orchid, and put his hands behind his back.\n\"We shall go to the receiving room,\" he said. \"You lead the way.\"", "characters": [{"name": "Locke", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Benjavier", "role": "MINOR"}, {"name": "Meraggio", "role": "ANTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Laval", "role": "MINOR"}, {"name": "Capa Raza", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Therin Throne", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Ben Javier", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Willa", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Don Salvara", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0422}}
{"story_id": "the_fifth_season_scene_007", "text": "“That’s a shame.” And then, because Syenite is beginning to understand why Alabaster is such an ass about this, she folds her hands. “Unfortunately, it wasn’t a request. Do you have a telegraph here? I’d like to send a message to the Fulcrum, let them know we’ll be delayed.”\n\nAsael’s eyes narrow, because of course they have a telegraph, and of course Syenite meant that as another dig. “Delayed.”\n\n“Well, yes.” Syen raises her eyebrows. She knows she’s not doing a good job of looking innocent, but she tries, at least. “How long do you think it will be before the governor is able to meet with us? The Fulcrum will want to know.” And she stands, as if to leave.\n\nAsael tilts her head, but Syenite can see the tension in her shoulders. “I thought you were more reasonable than your colleague. You’re actually going to walk out of here, and not clear our harbor, in a fit of pique.”\n\n“It isn’t a fit of pique.” Now Syen’s mad for real. Now she gets it. She looks down at Asael, who sits there, smug and secure in her big chair behind her big desk, and it’s an actual fight to keep her fists from clenching, her jaw muscles from flexing. “Would you tolerate this treatment, in our position?”\n\n“Of course I would!” Asael straightens, surprised into an actual reaction for once. “The governor has no time for—”\n\n“No, you wouldn’t tolerate it. Because if you were in my position, you’d be the representative of an independent and powerful organization, not some two-quartz backwater flunky. You would expect to be treated like a skilled expert who’s been learning her craft since childhood. Like someone who plies an important and difficult trade, and who’s come to perform a task that dictates your comm’s livelihood.”\n\nAsael is staring at her. Syenite pauses, takes a deep breath. She must stay polite, and wield that politeness like a finely knapped glassknife. She must be cold and calm in her anger, lest a lack of self-control be dismissed as the mark of monstrosity. Once the heat behind her eyes has eased, she steps forward.\n\n“And yet you haven’t shaken our hands, Asael Leader. You didn’t look us in the eye when we first met. You still haven’t offered that cup of safe that Alabaster suggested yesterday. Would you do that to a decreed ’mest from the Seventh University? Would you do it to a master geneer, come to repair the comm’s hydro? Would you do it to a representative of the Strongbacks’ Union for your own comm?”\n\nAsael actually flinches as the analogies finally get through to her. Syenite waits in silence, letting it gather pressure. Finally Asael says, “I see.”\n\n“Maybe you do.” She keeps waiting, and Asael sighs.\n\n“What do you want? An apology? Then I apologize. You must remember, though, that most normal people have never seen an orogene, let alone had to do business with one, and—” She spreads her hands. “Isn’t it understandable that we might be… uncomfortable?”\n\n“Discomfort is understandable. It’s the rudeness that isn’t.” Rust this. This woman doesn’t deserve the effort of her explanation. Syen decides to save that for someone who matters. “And that’s a really shitty apology. ‘I’m sorry you’re so abnormal that I can’t manage to treat you like a human being.’”\n\n“You’re a rogga,” Asael snaps, and then has the gall to look surprised at herself.\n\n“Well.” Syenite makes herself smile. “At least that’s out in the open.” She shakes her head and turns toward the door. “I’ll come back tomorrow. Maybe you’ll have had time to check the governor’s schedule by then.”\n\n“You are under contract,” Asael says, her voice tight enough to quaver. “You are required to perform the service for which we have paid your organization.”\n\n“And we will.” Syenite reaches the door and stops with her hand on the handle, shrugging. “But the contract doesn’t specify how long we have, upon arrival, to get it done.” She’s bluffing. She has no idea what’s in the contract. But she’s willing to bet Asael doesn’t, either; a deputy governor doesn’t sound important enough to know that sort of thing. “Thanks for the stay at the Season’s End, by the way. The beds are very comfortable. And the food’s delicious.”\n\nThat, of course, does it. Asael stands as well. “Stay here. I’ll go and speak with the governor.”\n\nSo Syen smiles pleasantly, and sits back down to wait. Asael leaves the room, and stays gone for long enough that Syen starts to doze off. She recovers when the door opens again, and another Coaster woman, elderly and portly, comes in with a chastened-looking Asael. The governor’s a man. Syenite sighs inwardly and braces herself for more weaponized politeness.\n\n“Syenite Orogene,” the woman says, and despite her rising ire Syenite is impressed by the gravity of her presence. The “orogene” after Syen’s name isn’t necessary, of course, but it’s a nice bit of much-needed courtesy—so Syen rises, and the woman immediately steps forward and offers a hand for her to shake. Her skin is cool and dry and harder than Syenite expected. No calluses, just hands that have done their share of everyday labor. “My name is Heresmith Leadership Allia. I’m the lieutenant governor. The governor genuinely is too busy to meet with you today, but I’ve cleared enough time on my schedule, and I hope my greeting will be sufficient… especially as it comes with an apology for your poor treatment thus far. I can assure you that Asael will be censured for her behavior, to remind her that it’s always good leadership to treat others—all others—with courtesy.”\n\nWell. The woman could be just playing a politician’s game, or she could be lying about being the lieutenant governor; maybe Asael’s found a very well-dressed janitor to play the part. Still, it’s an effort at compromise, and Syen will take it.\n\n“Thank you,” she says, with genuine gratitude. “I’ll convey your apology to my colleague Alabaster.”\n\n“Good. Please also tell him that Allia will pay your expenses, per our agreed-upon contract, for up to three days before and three after your clearing of the harbor.” And there’s an edge to her smile now, which Syenite knows she probably deserves. This woman, it seems, actually has read the contract.\n\nDoesn’t matter, though. “I appreciate the clarification.”\n\n“Is there anything else you need during your stay? Asael would be happy to provide a tour of the city, for example.”\n\nDamn. Syen likes this woman. She stifles the urge to smile and glances at Asael, who’s managed to compose herself by this point; she gazes impassively back at Syenite. And Syen’s tempted to do what Alabaster probably would, and take Heresmith up on that tacit offer of Asael’s humiliation. But Syenite is tired, and this whole trip’s been hellish, and the sooner it’s over and she’s back home at the Fulcrum, the better.\n\n“No need,” she says, and does Asael’s face twitch a little in suppressed relief? “I’d actually like to get a look at the harbor, if I may, so that I can assess the problem.”\n\n“Of course. But surely you’d like refreshment first? At least a cup of safe.”\n\nSyenite can’t help it now. Her lips twitch. “I don’t actually like safe, I should probably say.”\n\n“No one does.” And there’s no mistaking the genuine smile on Heresmith’s face. “Anything else, then, before we go?”\n\nNow it’s Syen’s turn to be surprised. “You’re coming with us?”\n\nHeresmith’s expression grows wry. “Well, our comm’s livelihood is dependent on you, after all. It seems only proper.”\n\nOh, yeah. This one’s a keeper. “Then please proceed, Heresmith Leader.” Syenite gestures toward the door, and they all head out.\n\n* * *\n\nThe harbor’s wrong.\n\nThey’re standing on a kind of boardwalk along the western curve of the harbor’s half circle. From there most of Allia can be seen, spreading up the caldera slopes that surround the waterfront. The city really is quite lovely. It’s a beautiful day, bright and warm, with a sky so deep and clear that Syenite thinks the stargazing at night should be amazing. Yet it’s what she can’t see—under the water, along the harbor bottom—that makes her skin crawl.\n\n“That’s not coral,” she says.\n\nHeresmith and Asael turn to her, both of them looking puzzled. “Pardon?” asks Heresmith.\n\nSyenite moves away from them, going to the railing and extending her hands. She doesn’t need to gesture; she just wants them to know she’s doing something. A Fulcrum orogene always reassures clients of their awareness and understanding of the situation, even when those clients have no actual idea what’s going on. “The harbor floor. The top layer is coral.” She thinks. She’s never felt coral before, but it feels like what she expected: layers of wriggling bright life that she can pull from, if she needs to, to fuel her orogeny; and a solid core of ancient calcified death. But the coral heap sits atop a humped ridge in the floor of the harbor, and although it feels natural—there are usually folds like this in places where land meets sea, she’s read—Syenite can tell it’s not.\n\nIt’s absolutely straight, for one thing. And huge; the ridge spans the width of the harbor. But more importantly, it isn’t there.\n\nThe rock beneath the raised layers of silt and sand, that is: She can’t feel it. She should be able to, if it’s pushing up the seafloor like this. She can feel the weight of the water atop it, and the rock deformed by its weight and pressure underneath, and the strata around it, but not the actual obstruction itself. There might as well be a big empty hole on the bottom of the harbor… around which the entire harbor floor has shaped itself.\n\nSyenite frowns. Her fingers spread and twitch, following the flow and curve of the sesuna. Soft slither of loose schist and sand and organic matter, cool press of solid bedrock, flow and dip. As she follows it, she belatedly remembers to narrate her explorations. “There’s something beneath the coral, buried in the ocean floor. Not far down. The rock underneath is compressed; it must be heavy…” But why can’t she feel it, if so? Why can she detect the obstruction only by its effect on everything nearby? “It’s strange.”\n\n“Is it relevant?” That’s Asael, maybe trying to sound professional and intelligent in order to get back into Heresmith’s good graces. “All we need is for the coral blockage to be destroyed.”\n\n“Yes, but the coral’s on top of it.” She searches for the coral and finds it all around the edges of the harbor; a theory forms. “That’s why this is the only place in the deep part of the harbor that’s blocked by coral. It’s growing on top of the thing, where the ocean floor has effectively been raised. Coral’s a thing of the shallows, but it can get plenty of sun-warmed water, along this ridge.”\n\n“Rusting Earth. Does that mean the coral will just grow back?” That’s one of the men who came with Asael and Heresmith. They’re a bunch of clerks, as far as Syenite can tell, and she keeps forgetting they’re present until they speak. “The whole point of this is to clear the harbor for good.”", "characters": [{"name": "Syenite", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Asael", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Alabaster", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Heresmith Leadership Allia", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Syen", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Coaster", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0021}}
{"story_id": "prince_of_thorns_scene_008", "text": "So we rode out from Norwood. The peasants watched us, all sullen and dazed, and Rike cursed them. As if it had been his idea to keep them from a Renar bonfire and now they owed him a cheer as he left. We left them the ruins of their town, decorated with the corpses of the men that ruined it. Poor compensation, especially after Rike and the brothers had stripped the dead of anything of worth. I reckoned we could make Crath City by nightfall, riding hard, and be banging on the gates of the Tall Castle before the moon rose.\n\nI shouldn’t have been turning for home, picking up my old ways, and thinking once more about vengeance upon the Count of Renar. That’s what instinct told me. But today instinct spoke with an old and dry voice and I no longer trusted it. I wanted to go home, perhaps because it felt as though something else required that I did not. I wanted to go home and if Hell rose up to stop me, it would make me desire it the more. We took the Castle Road, up through the garden lands of Ancrath. Our path ran alongside gentle streams, between small woods and quiet farms. I’d forgotten how green it was. I’d grown used to a world of churned mud, burned fields, smoke-grey skies, and the dead rotting on the ground. The sun found us, pushing its way through high cloud. In the warmth our column slowed until the clatter of hooves broke into lazy thuds. Gerrod paused where a three-bar gate led through the hedgerow. Beyond it, a field, golden with wheat, rolled out before us. He tore at the long grass around the gatepost. It felt as if God had poured honey over the land, sweet and slow, holding everything at peace. Norwood lay fifteen miles, and a thousand years, behind us.\n\n“Good to be back, eh, Jorg?” Makin pulled up beside me. He leaned forward in his stirrups and drank in the air. “Smells of home.”\n\nAnd it did. The scent of warm earth took me back, back to times when my world was small, and safe.\n\n“I hate this place,” I said. He looked shocked at that, and Makin was never an easy man to shock. “It’s a poison men take willingly, knowing it will make them weak.”\n\nI gave Gerrod my heels and let him hurry up the road. Makin caught me up and cantered alongside. We passed Rike and Burlow at the crossroads, throwing rocks at a scarecrow.\n\n“Men fight for their homeland, Prince,” Makin said. “It’s the land they defend. The King and the land.”\n\nI turned to holler at the stragglers. “Close the line!”\n\nMakin kept pace, waiting for an answer. “Let the soldiers die for their land,” I said to him. “If the time comes to sacrifice these fields in the cause of victory, I’ll let them burn in a heartbeat. Anything that you cannot sacrifice pins you. Makes you predictable, makes you weak.”\n\nWe rode on at a trot, west, trying to catch the sun.\n\nSoon enough we found the garrison at Chelny Ford. Or rather they found us. The watchtower must have seen us on the trail, and fifty men came out along the Castle Road to block our way.\n\nI pulled up a few yards short of the pikemen, strung across the road in a bristling hedge, double-ranked. The rest of the squad waited behind the pike-wall, with drawn swords, save for a dozen archers arrayed amongst the corn in the field to our right. A score of heifers, in the field opposite, saw our approach and idled over to investigate.\n\n“Men of Chelny Ford,” I called out. “Well met. Who leads here?”\n\nMakin came up behind me, the rest of the brothers trailing in after him, easy in their saddles.\n\nA tall man stepped forward between two pikemen, but not too far forward, no idiot this one. He wore the Ancrath colours over a long chain shirt, and an iron pot-helm low on his brow. To my right a dozen sets of white knuckles strained on bowstrings. To my left the heifers watched from behind the hedge, complacent and chewing on the cud.\n\n“I’m Captain Coddin.” He had to raise his voice as one of the cows let out a low moo. “The King signs mercenaries at Relston Fayre. Armed bands are not permitted to roam into Ancrath. State your business.” He kept his eyes on Makin, looking for his answer there.\n\nI didn’t care for being dismissed as a child, but there’s a time and place for taking offence. Besides, old Coddin seemed to know his stuff. Putting Brother Gemt out of his misery was one thing, but wasting one of Father’s captains quite another.\n\nI had my visor up already, so I used it to pull my helm off. “Father Gomst!” I called for the priest, and the brothers shuffled their horses aside with a few mutters to let the old fellow past. He wasn’t much to look at. He’d hacked off that beard he grew in the gibbet-cage, but grey tufts still decorated his face in random clusters, and his priestly robes seemed more mud than cloth.\n\n“Captain Coddin,” I said. “Do you know this priest, Father Gomst?”\n\nCoddin raised an eyebrow at that. He had a pale face, and now it went paler. His mouth took on a hard edge, like a man who knows he’s the butt of a joke that he hasn’t worked out yet. “Aye,” he said. “The King’s priest.” He snapped his heels together and inclined his head, as if he were in court. It seemed funny out there in the road, with the birds tweeting overhead and the stink of the cows washing over us.\n\n“Father Gomst,” I said. “Pray tell Captain Coddin who I am.”\n\nThe old fellow puffed himself up a bit. He’d been listless and grey since Norwood, but now he tried to find a crumb or two of authority.\n\n“Prince Honorous Jorg Ancrath sits before you, Captain. Lost and now returned, he is bound for his royal father’s court, and you would do well to see that he gets there with proper escort . . .” He glanced at me, screwing up what courage he had behind the foolish remnants of his beard. “And a bath.”\n\nA little snigger went up at that, on both sides of our standoff. It doesn’t pay to underestimate a cleric. They know the power of words and they’ll use them to their own ends. My palm ached for the hilt of my sword. I saw old Gomst’s head falling from his shoulders, bouncing once, twice, and rolling to a halt by the hooves of a black-and-white heifer. I pushed the vision away.\n\n“No bath. It’s about time for a little road-stink at court. Soft words and rose water may please the gentry, but those that fight the war live dirty. I return to my father as a man who has shared the soldier’s lot. Let him know the truth of it.” I let my words carry on the still air, and kept my eyes on Gomsty. He had the wit to look away.\n\nMy speech earned no rousing cheer, but Coddin bowed his head and we had no further mention of baths. A shame, truth be told, because I’d been looking forward to a hot tub ever since I decided to turn for home.\n\nSo Coddin left his second to command the garrison, and rode with us. His escort of two dozen riders swelled our numbers to nearly sixty. Makin carried a lance from the Ford armoury now, flying the Ancrath colours and royal crest. The garrison riders spread word through the villages as we passed. “Prince Jorg, Prince Jorg returned from the dead.” The news stole ahead of us, until each town presented a larger and better prepared reception. Captain Coddin sent a rider to the King before we left Chelny Ford, but even without his message, they would know of us in the Tall Castle well before we got there.\n\nAt Bains Town the bunting stretched across Main Street, six minstrels, sporting lute and clavichord, played “The King’s Sword” with more gusto than skill, jugglers exchanged twirling fire-brands, and a bear danced before the mill pond. And the crowds! People packed in so tight we’d no hope of riding through. A fat woman in a tent of a dress which was striped like a tourney pavilion saw me amid the van. She pointed and gave a shriek that drowned the minstrels out, “Prince Jorg! The Stolen Prince!” The whole place went mad at that, cheering and crying. They surged forward like wild things. Coddin had his men in quick, though. I forgave him his earlier slight for that. If peasants had reached Rike, we’d have had red slaughter.\n\nOn the Lich Road the brothers were more scared, but that’s the only time I’ve seen more fear in them than there at Bains Town. They none of them knew what to make of it. Grumlow’s left hand never left his dagger. Red Kent grinned like a maniac, terror in his eyes. Still, they’d learn fast enough. When they figured out the welcome that lay ahead. When they’d seen the taverns and the whores. Well, there’d be no dragging them out of Bains Town in a week.\n\nOne of the minstrels found a horn, and a harsh note cut through the tumult. Guards, red-robed with black chain beneath, cleared a path, and no less a man than Lord Nossar of Elm emerged before us. I recognized the man from court. He looked slightly fatter in his gilded show-plate and velvets, rather more grey in the beard spilling down over his breastplate, but pretty much the same jolly old Nossar who rode me on his shoulders once upon a time.\n\n“Prince Jorg!” The old man’s voice broke for a moment. I could see tears shining in his eyes. It caught at me, that did. I felt it hook something in my chest. I didn’t like it.\n\n“Lord Nossar,” I gave back, and let a smile curl my lip. The same smile I gave Gemt before I let him have my knife. I saw a flicker in Nossar’s eyes then. Just a moment of doubt.\n\nHe rallied himself. “Prince Jorg! Beyond all hope, you’ve returned to us. I cursed the messenger for a liar, but here you are.” He had the deepest voice, rich and golden. Old Nossar spoke and you knew it was truth, you knew he liked you, it wrapped you up all warm and safe, that voice did. “Will you honour my house, Prince Jorg, and stay a night?”\n\nI could see the brothers exchanging glances, eyeing women in the crowd. The mill pond burned crimson with the dying sun. North, above the dark line of Rennat Forest, the smoke of Crath City stained a darkening sky.\n\n“My lord, it’s a gracious invitation, but I mean to sleep in the Tall Castle tonight. I’ve been away too long,” I said.\n\nI could see the worry on him. It hung on every crag of the man’s face. He wanted to say more, but not here. I wondered if Father set him to detain me.\n\n“Prince . . .” He lifted a hand, his eyes seeking mine.\n\nI felt that hook in my chest again. He would set me down in his high hall and talk of old times in that golden voice. He’d speak of William, and Mother. If there was a man who could disarm me, Nossar was that man.\n\n“I thank you for the welcome, Lord Nossar.” I gave him court formality, curt and final.\n\nI had to haul on the reins to turn Gerrod. I think even horses liked Nossar. I led the brothers around by the river trail, trampling over some farmer’s autumn turnips. The peasants cheered on, not sure what was happening, but cheering all the same.\n\nWe came to the Tall Castle by the cliff path, avoiding the sprawl of Crath City. The lights lay below us. Streets beaded with torchlight, the glow of fire and lamp rising from windows not yet shuttered against the cool of the night. The watchmen’s lanterns picked out the Old City wall, a skewed semicircle, tapering down to the river where the houses spilled out beyond the walls, into the valley, reaching out along the river. We came to the West Gate, the one place we could reach the High City without trailing up through the narrow streets of the Old City. The guards raised the portcullises for us, first one, then the next, then the next. Ten minutes of creaking windlass and clanking chain. I wondered why the three gates were down. Did our foes truly press so close we must triple-gate the High Wall?\n\nThe gate captain came out whilst his men sweated to raise the last portcullis. Archers watched from the battlements high above. No bunting here. I recognized the man vaguely, as old as Gomst, salt-and-pepper hair. It was his sour expression I recalled best, pinched around the mouth as if he’d just that moment sucked a lemon.\n\n“Prince Jorg, we are told?” He peered up at me, raising his torch almost to my face. Evidently I had enough of the King’s look about me to satisfy his curiosity. He lowered the torch fast enough and took a step back. I’m told I have my father’s eyes. Maybe I do, though mine are darker. We could both give a stare that made men think again. I’ve always thought I look too girlish. My mouth too much the rosebud, my cheekbones too high and fine. It’s of no great consequence. I’ve learned to wear my face as a mask, and generally I can write what I choose on it.\n\nThe captain nodded to Captain Coddin. He passed his gaze over Makin without a flicker, missed Father Gomst in the crowd, and lingered instead on the Nuban, before casting a dubious eye over Rike.\n\n“I can find accommodation for your men in the Low City, Prince Jorg,” he said. By the Low City he meant the sprawl beyond the walls of Old City.\n\n“My companions can board with me at the castle,” I said.\n\n“King Olidan requires only your presence, Prince Jorg,” the gate captain said. “And that of Father Gomst, and Captain Bortha if he is with you?”\n\nMakin raised a mailed hand. Both the gate captain’s eyebrows vanished up beneath his helm at that. “Makin Bortha? No . . . ?”\n\n“One and the same,” Makin said. He gave the man a broad grin, showing altogether too many teeth. “Been a while, Relkin, you old bastard.”\n\n“King Olidan requires” . . . no room for manoeuvre there. A polite little “get your road-scum down to the slums.” At least Relkin made it clear enough from the start, rather than letting me lose face by arguing the odds before over-ruling me with “King Olidan requires.”\n\n“Elban, take the brothers down to the river and find some rooms. There’s a tavern, The Falling Angel, should be big enough for you all,” I said.", "characters": [{"name": "Jorg", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Makin", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Rike", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Burlow", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Gomst", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Father Gomst"]}, {"name": "Coddin", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Captain Coddin"]}, {"name": "Glaward", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Grumlow", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Gerrod", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Nossar", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Olidan", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Renar", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Gemt", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Relkin", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Honorous", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Norwood", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0067}}
{"story_id": "storm_front_scene_009", "text": "McAnally’s is a pub a few blocks from my office. I go there when I’m feeling stressed, or when I have a few extra bucks to spend on a nice dinner. A lot of us fringe types do. Mac, the pub’s owner, is used to wizards and all the problems that come along with us. There aren’t any video games at McAnally’s. There are no televisions or expensive computer trivia games. There isn’t even a jukebox. Mac keeps a player piano instead. It’s less likely to go haywire around us.\n\nI say pub in all the best senses of the word. When you walk in, you take several steps down into a room with a deadly combination of a low clearance and ceiling fans. If you’re tall, like me, you walk carefully in McAnally’s. There are thirteen stools at the bar and thirteen tables in the room. Thirteen windows, set up high in the wall in order to be above ground level, let some light from the street into the place. Thirteen mirrors on the walls cast back reflections of the patrons in dim detail, and give the illusion of more space. Thirteen wooden columns, carved with likenesses from folktales and legends of the Old World, make it difficult to walk around the place without weaving a circuitous route—they also quite intentionally break up the flow of random energies, dispelling to one degree or another the auras that gather around broody, grumpy wizards and keeping them from manifesting in unintentional and colorful ways. The colors are all muted, earth browns and sea greens. The first time I entered McAnally’s, I felt like a wolf returning to an old, favorite den. Mac makes his own beer, ale really, and it’s the best stuff in the city. His food is cooked on a wood-burning stove. And you can damn well walk your own self over to the bar to pick up your order when it’s ready, according to Mac. It’s my sort of place.\n\nSince the calls to the morgues had turned up nothing, I kept a few bills out of Monica Sells’s retainer and took myself to McAnally’s. After the kind of day I’d had, I deserved some of Mac’s ale and someone else’s cooking. It was going to be a long night, too, once I went home and started trying to figure out how whoever it was had pulled off the death spell used on Johnny Marcone’s hatchet man, Tommy Tomm, and his girlfriend, Jennifer Stanton.\n\n“Dresden,” Mac greeted me, when I sat down at the bar. The dim, comfortable room was empty, but for a pair of men I recognized by sight at a back table, playing chess. Mac is a tall, almost gangly man of indeterminate age, though there’s a sense to him that speaks of enough wisdom and strength that I wouldn’t venture that he was less than fifty. He has squinty eyes and a smile that is rare and mischievous when it manifests. Mac never says much, but when he does it’s almost always worth listening to.\n\n“Hey there, Mac,” I hailed him. “Been one hell of a day. Give me a steak sandwich, fries, ale.”\n\n“Ungh,” Mac said. He opened a bottle of his ale and began to pour it warm, staring past me, into the middle distance. He does that with everyone. Considering his clientele, I don’t blame him. I wouldn’t chance looking them in the face, either.\n\n“You hear about what happened at the Madison?”\n\n“Ungh,” he confirmed.\n\n“Nasty business.”\n\nSuch an inane comment apparently didn’t merit even a grunted reply. Mac set my drink out and turned to the stove behind the bar, checking the wood and raking it back and forth to provide even heating for it.\n\nI picked up a prethumbed newspaper nearby and scanned the headlines. “Hey, look at this. Another ThreeEye rampage. Jesus, this stuff is worse than crack.” The article detailed the virtual demolition of a neighborhood grocery store by a pair of ThreeEye junkies who were convinced that the place was destined to explode and wanted to beat destiny to the punch.\n\n“Ungh.”\n\n“You ever seen anything like this?”\n\nMac shook his head.\n\n“They say the stuff gives you the third sight,” I said, reading the article. Both junkies had been admitted to the hospital and were in critical condition, after collapsing at the scene. “But you know what?”\n\nMac looked back at me from the stove, while he cooked.\n\n“I don’t think that’s possible. What a bunch of crap. Trying to sell these poor kids on the idea that they can do magic.”\n\nMac nodded at me.\n\n“If it was serious stuff, the department would have already called me by now.”\n\nMac shrugged, turning back to the stove. Then he squinted up and peered into the dim reflection of the mirror behind the bar.\n\n“Harry,” he said, “you were followed.”\n\nI had been too tense for too much of the day to avoid feeling my shoulders constrict in a sudden twinge. I put both hands around my mug and brought a few phrases of quasi-Latin to mind. It never hurt to be ready to defend myself, in case someone was intending to hurt me. I watched someone approach, a dim shape in the reflection cast by the ancient, worn mirror. Mac went on with cooking, unperturbed. Nothing much perturbed Mac.\n\nI smelled her perfume before I turned around. “Why, Miss Rodriguez,” I said. “It’s always pleasant to see you.”\n\nShe came to an abrupt stop a couple of paces from me, apparently disconcerted. One of the advantages of being a wizard is that people always attribute anything you do to magic, if no other immediate explanation leaps to mind. She probably wouldn’t think about her perfume giving her identity away when she could assign my mysterious, blind identification of her to my mystical powers.\n\n“Come on,” I told her. “Sit down. I’ll get you a drink while I refuse to tell you anything.”\n\n“Harry,” she admonished me, “you don’t know I’m here on business.” She sat down on the barstool next to me. She was a woman of average height and striking, dark beauty, wearing a crisp business jacket and skirt, hose, pumps. Her dark, straight hair was trimmed in a neat cut that ended at the nape of her neck and was parted off of the dark skin of her forehead, emphasizing the lazy appeal of her dark eyes.\n\n“Susan,” I chided her, “you wouldn’t be in this place if you weren’t. Did you have a good time in Branson?”\n\nSusan Rodriguez was a reporter for the Chicago Arcane, a yellow magazine that covered all sorts of supernatural and paranormal events throughout the Midwest. Usually, the events they covered weren’t much better than “Monkey Man Seen With Elvis’s Love Child,” or “JFK’s Mutant Ghost Abducts Shapeshifting Girl Scout.” But once in a great, great while, the Arcane covered something that was real. Like the Unseelie Incursion of 1994, when the entire city of Milwaukee had simply vanished for two hours. Gone. Government satellite photos showed the river valley covered with trees and empty of life or human habitation. All communications ceased. Then, a few hours later, there it was, back again, and no one in the city itself the wiser.\n\nShe had also been hanging around my investigation in Branson the previous week. She had been tracking me ever since interviewing me for a feature story, right after I’d opened up my business. I had to hand it to her—she had instincts. And enough curiosity to get her into ten kinds of trouble. She had tricked me into meeting her eyes at the conclusion of our first interview, an eager young reporter investigating an angle on her interviewee. She was the one who had fainted after we’d soulgazed.\n\nShe smirked at me. I liked her smirk. It did interesting things to her lips, and hers were already attractive. “You should have stayed around for the show,” she said. “It was pretty impressive.” She put her purse on the bar and slid up onto the stool beside me.\n\n“No thanks,” I told her. “I’m pretty sure it wasn’t for me.”\n\n“My editor loved the coverage. She’s convinced it’s going to win an award of some kind.”\n\n“I can see it now,” I told her. “‘Mysterious Visions Haunt Drug-Using Country Star.’ Real hard-hitting paranormal journalism, that.” I glanced at her, and she met my eyes without fear. She didn’t let me see if my gibe had ruffled her.\n\n“I heard you got called in by the S.I. director today,” she told me. She leaned toward me, enough that a glance down would have afforded an interesting angle to the V of her white shirt. “I’d love to hear you tell me about this one, Harry.” She quirked a smile at me that promised things.\n\nI almost smiled back at her. “Sorry,” I told her. “I have a standard nondisclosure agreement with the city.”\n\n“Something off the record, then?” she asked. “Rumor has it that these killings were pretty sensational.”\n\n“Can’t help you, Susan,” I told her. “Wild horses couldn’t drag it out of me, et cetera.”\n\n“Just a hint,” she pressed. “A word of comment. Something shared between two people who are very attracted to one another.”\n\n“Which two people would that be?”\n\nShe put an elbow on the counter and propped her chin in her hand, studying me through narrowed eyes and thick, long lashes. One of the things that appealed to me about her was that even though she used her charm and femininity relentlessly in pursuit of her stories, she had no concept of just how attractive she really was—I had seen that when I looked within her last year. “Harry Dresden,” she said, “you are a thoroughly maddening man.” Her eyes narrowed a bit further. “You didn’t look down my blouse even once, did you?” she accused.\n\nI took a sip of my ale and beckoned Mac to pour her one as well. He did. “Guilty.”\n\n“Most men are off-balance by now,” she complained. “What does it take with you, anyway, Dresden?”\n\n“I am pure of heart and mind,” I told her. “I cannot be corrupted.”\n\nShe stared at me in frustration for a moment. Then she tilted back her head to laugh. She had a good laugh, too, throaty and rich. I did look down at her chest when she did that, just for a second. A pure heart and mind only takes you so far—sooner or later the hormones have their say, too. I mean, I’m not a teenager or anything, anymore, but I’m not exactly an expert in things like this, either. Call it an overwhelming interest in my professional career, but I’ve never had much time for dating or the fair sex in general. And when I have, it hasn’t turned out too well.\n\nSusan was a known quantity—she was attractive, bright, appealing, her motivations were clear and simple, and she was honest in pursuing them. She flirted with me because she wanted information as much as because she thought I was attractive. Sometimes she got it. Sometimes she didn’t. This one was way too hot for Susan or the Arcane to touch, and if Murphy heard I’d tipped someone off about what had happened, she’d have my heart between two pieces of bread for lunch.\n\n“I’ll tell you what, Harry,” she said. “How about if I ask some questions, and you just answer them with a yes or a no?”\n\n“No,” I said promptly. Dammit. I am a poor liar, and it didn’t take a reporter with Susan’s brains to tell it.\n\nHer eyes glittered with cheerfully malicious ambition. “Was Tommy Tomm murdered by a paranormal being or means?”\n\n“No,” I said again, stubbornly.\n\n“No, he wasn’t?” Susan asked. “Or no, it wasn’t a paranormal being?”\n\nI glanced at Mac as though to appeal for help. Mac ignored me. Mac doesn’t take sides. Mac is wise.\n\n“No, I’m not going to answer questions,” I said.\n\n“Do the police have any leads? Any suspects?”\n\n“No.”\n\n“Are you a suspect yourself, Harry?”\n\nDisturbing thought. “No,” I said, exasperated. “Susan—”\n\n“Would you mind having dinner with me Saturday night?”\n\n“No! I—” I blinked at her. “What?”\n\nShe smiled at me, leaned over, and kissed me on the cheek. Her lips, which I’d admired so much, felt very, very nice. “Super,” she said. “I’ll pick you up at your place. Say around nine?”\n\n“Did I just miss something?” I asked her.\n\nShe nodded, dark eyes sparkling with humor. “I’m going to take you to a fantastic dinner. Have you ever eaten at the Pump Room? At the Ambassador East?”\n\nI shook my head.\n\n“Steaks you wouldn’t believe,” she assured me. “And the most romantic atmosphere. Jackets and ties required. Can you manage?”\n\n“Um. Yes?” I said, carefully. “This is the answer to the question of whether or not I’ll go out with you, right?”\n\n“No,” Susan said, with a smile. “That was the answer I tricked out of you, so you’re stuck, there. I just want to make sure you own something besides jeans and button-down Western shirts.”\n\n“Oh. Yes,” I said.\n\n“Super,” she repeated, and kissed me on the cheek once more as she stood up and gathered her purse. “Saturday, then.” She drew back and quirked her smirky little smile at me. It was a killer look, sultry and appealing. “I’ll be there. With bells on.”\n\nShe turned and walked out. I sort of turned to stare after her. My jaw slid off the bar as I did and landed on the floor.\n\nHad I just agreed to a date? Or an interrogation session?\n\n“Probably both,” I muttered.\n\nMac slapped my steak sandwich and fries down in front of me. I put down some money, morosely, and he made change.\n\n“She’s going to do nothing but try to trick information out of me that I shouldn’t be giving her, Mac,” I said.\n\n“Ungh,” Mac agreed.\n\n“Why did I say yes?”\n\nMac shrugged.\n\n“She’s pretty,” I said. “Smart. Sexy.”\n\n“Ungh.”\n\n“Any red-blooded man would have done the same thing.”\n\n“Hngh,” Mac snorted.\n\n“Well. Maybe not you.”\n\nMac smiled a bit, mollified.\n\n“Still. It’s going to make trouble for me. I must be crazy to go for someone like that.” I picked up my sandwich, and sighed.\n\n“Dumb,” Mac said.\n\n“I just said she was smart, Mac.”\n\nMac’s face flickered into that smile, and it made him look years younger, almost boyish. “Not her,” he said. “You.”\n\nI ate my dinner. And had to admit that he was right.\n\nThis threw a wrench into my plans. My best idea for poking around the Sells lake house and getting information had to be carried out at night. And I already had tomorrow night slated for a talk with Bianca, since I had a feeling Murphy and Carmichael would fail to turn up any cooperation from the vampiress. That meant I would have to drive out to Lake Providence tonight, since Saturday night was now occupied by the date with Susan—or at least the premidnight portion was.\n\nMy mouth went dry when I considered that maybe the rest of the night might be occupied, too. One never knew. She had dizzied me and made me look like an idiot, and she was probably going to try every trick she knew to drag more information out of me for the Monday morning release of the Arcane. On the other hand, she was sexy, intelligent, and at least a little attracted to me. That indicated that more might happen than just talk and dinner. Didn’t it?\n\nThe question was, did I really want that to happen?\n\nI had been a miserable failure in relationships, ever since my first love went sour. I mean, a lot of teenage guys fail in their first relationships.\n\nNot many of them murder the girl involved.\n\nI shied away from that line of thought, lest it bring up too many old memories.\n\nI left McAnally’s, after Mac had handed me a doggy bag with a grunt of “Mister,” by way of explanation. The chess game in the corner was still in progress, both players puffing up a sweet-smelling smog cloud from their pipes. I tried to figure out how to deal with Susan, while I walked out to my car. Did I need to clean up my apartment? Did I have all the ingredients for the spell I would cast at the lake house later tonight? Would Murphy go through the roof when I talked to Bianca?\n\nI could still feel Susan’s kiss lingering on my cheek as I got in the car.\n\nI shook my head, bewildered. They say we wizards are subtle.

{"story_id": "a_little_hatred_scene_010", "text": "‘You killed this one,’ said Isern. The lad knelt there, making these squeaky little gasps as he tried to reach around his back to the arrow shaft, though what he’d do if he got his fingertips to it, Rikke had no idea. Probably he’d no idea, either. Isern was the only one thinking clearly right then. She leaned down and calmly plucked the knife from the lad’s belt. ‘Was hoping to set him a question or two, but he’ll be giving no answers with that shaft in his lung.’\n\n\t\t\tAs if to prove the point, he coughed some blood into his hand, and stared over it at Rikke. He looked a bit offended, like she’d said something hurtful.\n\n\t\t\t‘Still, no one ever gets things all their own way.’ Rikke jumped at the crack as Isern rammed the lad’s knife into the crown of his head. His eyes rolled up and his leg kicked and his back arched. Just like hers did, maybe, when a fit came upon her.\n\n\t\t\tThe hairs were standing on Rikke’s arms as he slumped down limp. She never saw a man killed before. All happened so fast she didn’t know how she ought to feel about it.\n\n\t\t\t‘They didn’t seem so bad,’ she said.\n\n\t\t\t‘For a girl struggling to penetrate the mists of the future, you don’t half miss what’s right in front of you.’ Isern was already rooting through the old man’s pockets, point of her tongue wedged in the hole in her teeth. ‘If you wait till they seem bad, you’ve waited way too long.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Could’ve given ’em a chance.’\n\n\t\t\t‘To what? Put you in the mud? Or drag you off to Stour Nightfall? Chafing would’ve been the least of your worries then, that boy’s got a bastard of a reputation.’ She caught the old man’s leg and dragged him from the path into the undergrowth, tossed his spear after. ‘Or were we going to invite ’em dancing through the woods with us, and all wear flowers in our hair and win ’em over to our side with my pretty words and your pretty smile?’\n\n\t\t\tRikke spat some chagga juice and wiped her chin, watching the blood work its way through the dirt about the lad’s nailed head. ‘Doubt my smile’s up to the task and I’m damn sure your words ain’t.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Then killing ’em was all o’ the one choices we had, eh? Your problem is you’re all heart.’ And she stabbed Rikke in the tit with one bony finger.\n\n\t\t\t‘Ow!’ Rikke took a step away, holding her arms across her chest. ‘That hurts, you know!’\n\n\t\t\t‘You’re all heart all over, so you feel every sting and buffet. You must make of your heart a stone.’ And Isern thumped her ribs with a fist, the finger bones around her neck rattling. ‘Ruthlessness is a quality much loved o’ the moon.’ As if to prove the point, she bent down and heaved the dead lad into the bushes. ‘A leader must be hard, so others don’t have to be.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Leader o’ what?’ muttered Rikke, rubbing at her sore tit. And that was when she caught a whiff of smoke, just like in her dream. As if it was a tugging she couldn’t resist, she set off down the path.\n\n\t\t\t‘Oy!’ called Isern around a stick of dry meat she’d rooted out of the big one’s pouch. ‘I need help dragging this big bastard!’\n\n\t\t\t‘No,’ whispered Rikke, the smell of fire getting stronger and her worry getting stronger with it. ‘No, no, no.’\n\n\t\t\tShe burst from the trees and into cold daylight, took a couple more wobbling steps and stopped, bow dangling from her limp hand.\n\n\t\t\tThe morning mist was long faded and she could see all the way across the patchwork of new-planted fields to Uffrith, wedged in against the grey sea behind its grey wall. Where her father’s old hall stood with the scraggy garden out the back. Safe, boring Uffrith, where she’d been born and raised. Only it was burning, just the way she’d seen it, and a great column of dark smoke rolled up and smudged the sky, drifting out over the restless sea.\n\n\t\t\t‘By the dead,’ she croaked.\n\n\t\t\tIsern wandered from the trees with her spear across her shoulders and a great smile across her face. ‘You know what this means?’\n\n\t\t\t‘War?’ whispered Rikke, horrified.\n\n\t\t\t‘Aye, that.’ Isern waved it away like it was a trifle. ‘But more to the matter, I was right!’ And she clapped Rikke on the shoulder so hard she near knocked her down. ‘You do have the Long Eye!’\n\n\t\t \t\t\tWhere the Fight’s Hottest\n\n\t\t\tIn battle, Leo’s father used to say, a man discovers who he truly is.\n\n\t\t\tThe Northmen were already turning to run as his horse crashed into them with a thrilling jolt.\n\n\t\t\tHe smashed one across the back of the helmet with the full force of the charge and ripped his head half off.\n\n\t\t\tHe snarled as he swung to the other side. A glimpse of a gawping face before his axe split it open, blood spraying in black streaks.\n\n\t\t\tOther riders tore into the Northmen, tossing them like broken dolls. He saw one horse spitted through the head with a spear. The rider turned a somersault as he was flung from the saddle.\n\n\t\t\tA lance shattered, a shard flying into Leo’s helmet with an echoing clang as he wrenched away. The world was a flickering slit of twisted faces, glinting steel, heaving bodies, half seen through the slot in his visor. Screams of men and mounts and metal mashed into one thought-crushing din.\n\n\t\t\tA horse swerved in front of him. Riderless, stirrups flapping. Ritter’s horse. He could tell by the yellow saddlecloth. A spear stabbed at him, jolting the shield on his arm, rocking him in his saddle. The point screeched down his armoured thigh.\n\n\t\t\tHe gripped the reins in his shield-hand as his mount bucked and snorted, face locked in an aching smile, flailing wildly with his axe on one side, then the other. He beat mindlessly at a shield with a black wolf painted on it, kicked at a man and sent him staggering back, then Barniva’s sword flashed as it took his arm off.\n\n\t\t\tHe saw Whitewater Jin swinging his mace, red hair tangled across gritted teeth. Just beyond him, Antaup was shrieking something as he tried to twist his spear free of bloody mail. Glaward wrestled with a Carl, both without weapons, all tangled with their reins. Leo hacked at the Northman and smashed his elbow back the wrong way, hacked again and sent him flopping into the mud.\n\n\t\t\tHe pointed at Stour Nightfall’s standard with his axe, black wolf streaming in the wind. He howled, roared, throat hoarse. No one could hear him with his visor down. No one could’ve heard him if it had been up. He hardly knew what he was saying. He flailed furiously at the milling bodies instead.\n\n\t\t\tSomeone clutched at his leg. Curly hair. Freckles. Looked bloody terrified. Everyone did. Didn’t seem to have a weapon. Maybe surrendering. Leo smashed Freckles on the top of the head with the rim of his shield, gave his horse the spurs and trampled him into the mud.\n\n\t\t\tThis was no place for good intentions. No place for tedious subtleties or boring counter-arguments. None of his mother’s carping on patience and caution. Everything was beautifully simple.\n\n\t\t\tIn battle, a man discovers who he truly is, and Leo was the hero he’d always dreamed of being.\n\n\t\t\tHe swung again but his axe felt strange. The blade had flown off, left him holding a bloody stick. He dropped it, dragged out his battle steel, buzzing fingers clumsy in his gauntlet, hilt greasy from the thickening rain. He realised the man he’d been hitting was dead. He’d fallen against the fence, so it looked as if he was standing but there was black pulp hanging out of his broken skull, so that was that.\n\n\t\t\tThe Northmen were crumbling. Running, squealing, being hacked down from behind, and Leo herded them towards their standard. Three riders had a whole crowd of them hemmed into a gateway, Barniva in their midst, scarred face flecked with blood as he chopped away with his heavy sword.\n\n\t\t\tThe standard-bearer was a huge man with desperate eyes and blood in his beard, still holding high the flag of the black wolf. Leo spurred right at him, blocked axe with shield, caught him with a sword-cut that screeched over his cheek guard and opened a great gash across his face, carved half his nose off. He tottered back and Whitewater Jin crushed the man’s helmet with his mace, blood squirting from under the rim. Leo kicked him over, tearing the standard from his limp hand as he fell. He thrust it up, laughing, gurgling, half-choking on his own spit then laughing again, his axe’s loop still stuck around his wrist so the broken haft clattered against his helmet.\n\n\t\t\tHad they won? He stared around for more enemies. A few ragged figures bounded through the crops towards the distant trees. Running for their lives, weapons abandoned. That was all.\n\n\t\t\tLeo ached all over: thighs from gripping his horse, shoulders from swinging his axe, hands from gripping the reins. The very soles of his feet throbbed from the effort. His chest heaved, breath booming in his helmet, damp, and hot, and tasting of salt. Might’ve bit his tongue somewhere. He fumbled with the buckle under his chin, finally tore the damn thing free. His skull burst with the noise, turned from fury to delight. The noise of victory.\n\n\t\t\tHe almost fell from his horse, clambered up onto the wall. Something was soft under his gauntleted hand. A Northman’s corpse, a broken spear sticking from his back. All he felt was giddy joy.\n\n\t\t\tNo corpses, no glory, after all. Might as well regret the peelings from a carrot. Someone was helping him up, giving him a steadying hand. Jurand. Always there when he needed him. Leo stood tall, the joyful faces of his men all turned towards him.\n\n\t\t\t‘The Young Lion!’ roared Glaward, climbing up beside him and clapping a heavy hand on his shoulder, making him wobble. Jurand stretched out his arms to catch him, but he didn’t fall. ‘Leo dan Brock!’ Soon they were all shouting his name, singing it like a prayer, chanting it like a magic word, stabbing their glittering weapons at the spitting sky.\n\n\t\t\t‘Leo! Leo! Leo!’\n\n\t\t\tIn battle, a man discovers who he truly is.\n\n\t\t\tHe felt drunk. He felt on fire. He felt like a king. He felt like a god. This was what he was made for!\n\n\t\t\t‘Victory!’ he roared, shaking his bloody sword and the Northmen’s bloody standard.\n\n\t\t\tBy the dead, could there be anything better than this?\n\n\t\t\tIn the lady governor’s tent, they were fighting a different kind of war. A war of patient study and careful calculation, of weighed odds and furrowed brows, of lines of supply and an awful lot of maps. A kind of war Leo frankly hadn’t the patience for.\n\n\t\t\tThe glow of victory had been dampened by the stiffening rain on the long trudge up from the valley, doused further by the niggling pain from a dozen cuts and bruises, and was almost entirely smothered by the cool stare his mother gave him as Leo pushed through the flap with Jurand and Whitewater Jin at his back.\n\n\t\t\tShe was in the midst of talking to a knight herald. Ridiculously tall, he had to stoop respectfully to attend to her.\n\n\t\t\t‘… please tell His Majesty we are doing everything to check the Northmen’s advance, but Uffrith is lost and we are giving ground. They struck with overwhelming force at three points and we are still gathering our troops. Ask him … no, beg him to send reinforcements.’\n\n\t\t\t‘I will, my Lady Governor.’ The knight herald nodded to Leo as he passed. ‘My congratulations on your victory, Lord Brock.’\n\n\t\t\t‘We don’t need the king’s bloody help!’ snapped Leo as soon as the flap dropped. ‘We can beat Black Calder’s dogs!’ His voice sounded oddly weak in the tent, deadened by wet cloth. It didn’t carry anywhere near so nicely as it had on the battlefield.\n\n\t\t\t‘Huh.’ His mother planted her fists on the table and frowned down at her maps. By the dead, sometimes he thought she loved those maps more than him. ‘If we are to fight the king’s battles, we should expect the king’s help.’\n\n\t\t\t‘You should’ve seen them run!’ Damn it, but Leo had been so sure of himself a few moments ago. He could charge a line of Carls and never falter, but a woman with a long neck and greying hair leached all the courage out of him. ‘They broke before we even got to them! We took a few dozen prisoners …’ He glanced towards Jurand, but he was giving Leo that doubtful look now, the one he used when he didn’t approve, the one he’d given him before the charge. ‘And the farm’s back in our hands … and …’\n\n\t\t\tHis mother let him stammer into silence before she glanced at his friends. ‘My thanks, Jurand. I’m sure you did your best to talk him out of it. And you, Whitewater. My son couldn’t ask for better friends or I for braver warriors.’\n\n\t\t\tJin slapped a heavy hand down on Leo’s shoulder. ‘It was Leo who led the—’\n\n\t\t\t‘You can go.’\n\n\t\t\tJin scratched sheepishly at his beard, showing a lot less warrior’s mettle than he had down in the valley. Jurand gave Leo the slightest apologetic wince. ‘Of course, Lady Finree.’ And they slunk from the tent, leaving Leo to fiddle weakly with the fringe of his captured standard.\n\n\t\t\tHis mother let the withering silence stretch a moment longer before she passed judgement. ‘You bloody fool.’\n\n\t\t\tHe’d known it was coming, but it still stung. ‘Because I actually fought?’\n\n\t\t\t‘Because of when you chose to fight, and how.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Great leaders go where the fight’s hottest!’ But he knew he sounded like the heroes in the badly written storybooks he used to love.\n\n\t\t\t‘You know who else you find where the fight’s hottest?’ asked his mother. ‘Dead men. We both know you’re not a fool, Leo. For whose benefit are you pretending to be one?’ She shook her head wearily. ‘I should never have let your father send you to live with the Dogman. All you learned in Uffrith was rashness, bad songs and a childish admiration for murderers. I should have sent you to Adua instead. I doubt your singing would be any better but at least you might have learned some subtlety.’\n\n\t\t\t‘There’s a time for subtlety and a time for action!’\n\n\t\t\t‘There is never a time for recklessness, Leo. Or for vanity.’\n\n\t\t\t‘We bloody won!’\n\n\t\t\t‘Won what? A worthless farm in a worthless valley? That was little more than a scouting party, and now the enemy will guess our strength.’ She gave a bitter snort as she turned back to her maps. ‘Or the lack of it.’\n\n\t\t\t‘I captured a standard.’ It seemed a pitiful thing now he really looked at it, though, clumsily stitched, the pole closer to a branch than a flagstaff. How could he have thought Stour Nightfall himself might ride beneath it?\n\n\t\t\t‘We have plenty of flags,’ said his mother. ‘It’s men to follow them we’re short of. Perhaps you could bring back a few regiments of those next time?’\n\n\t\t\t‘Damn it, Mother, I don’t know how to please you—’\n\n\t\t\t‘Listen to what you’re told. Learn from those who know better. Be brave, by all means, but don’t be rash. Above all, don’t get yourself bloody killed! You’ve always known exactly how to please me, Leo, but you choose to please yourself.’\n\n\t\t\t‘You can’t understand! You’re not …’ He waved an impatient hand, failing, as always, to quite find the right words. ‘A man,’ he finished lamely.\n\n\t\t\tShe raised one brow. ‘Had I been confused on that point, it was put beyond doubt when I pushed you out of my womb. Have you any notion how much you weighed as a baby? Spend two days shitting an anvil and we’ll talk again.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Bloody hell, Mother! I mean that men will look up to a certain kind of man, and—’\n\n\t\t\t‘Like your friend Ritter looked up to you?’\n\n\t\t\tLeo was caught out by the memory of that riderless horse clattering past. He realised he hadn’t seen Ritter’s face among his friends when they celebrated. Realised he hadn’t even thought about that until now.", "characters": [{"name": "Rikke", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Isern", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Stour Nightfall", "role": "ANTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Leo dan Brock", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Jurand", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Whitewater Jin", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Barniva", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0044}}
{"story_id": "a_little_hatred_scene_011", "text": "‘By the dead,’ she heard the woman mutter above, and then, with forced good cheer, ‘Chief! How’s the day?’\n\n\t\t\t‘Bloodless so far, but it’s still early.’ The voice of Stour Nightfall himself, then. A whining sort of voice for a famous warrior. Sounded like a boy on the edge of a tantrum. ‘They’re thin sauce, these Southerners, always trickling away. The Bloody-Nine had Rudd Threetrees to fight, and Black Dow, and Harding Grim and all the rest. How’s a man meant to win a great name without great enemies to weigh it against?’\n\n\t\t\tA brief pause. ‘It’s a tester, all right,’ said the woman.\n\n\t\t\t‘I’ve a task for you, Wonderful. There’s a girl out in these woods.’ Rikke had a bad feeling in her stomach. Worse than the hunger, and she shrank against the bank like she could become one with the dirt. ‘I want her.’\n\n\t\t\tA snorting chuckle from the enthusiastic pisser. ‘Well, who wouldn’t want a girl out in the woods?’ There was a silence, like the jest had miscarried. Certainly Rikke wasn’t fucking laughing. ‘How do we tell this girl from another?’\n\n\t\t\t‘They say she’s got a twitchy way. She’ll have a gold ring through her nose, maybe a cross painted over her eye.’\n\n\t\t\tRikke touched the tip of her tongue to the ring through her nose and whispered, ‘Fuck.’\n\n\t\t\t‘She might have some witch of a hillwoman with her. That you can kill. But the girl we need alive.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Must be important,’ said the woman called Wonderful.\n\n\t\t\tNightfall gave a little hooting giggle. ‘Well, there’s the thing. She’s the Dogman’s daughter.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Double fuck,’ mouthed Rikke.\n\n\t\t\t‘Shhhhhhh,’ hissed Isern.\n\n\t\t\t‘What happens if we catch her?’\n\n\t\t\tAn unhappy grunt. ‘Well, if my father gets her, I daresay he’ll ransom her back, dangle her as bait, use her to get his way when it comes to talking peace.’ And Nightfall spat out the word like it tasted bad. ‘You know my father. Plans within plans.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Always been clever, Black Calder,’ came the man’s voice.\n\n\t\t\t‘I see things different. How I see it, the way you break your enemy is you break what they love. Way I hear it, those old fools on the other side love that twitching bitch. Sort of a little mascot for ’em.’ Rikke heard the smile in his voice. ‘So if I get hold of her, I’ll strip her, and whip her, and pull her teeth out, and maybe get some Thralls to fuck her, out between the lines where everyone can hear her squealing.’ Bit of a silence, and Rikke heard her own breath coming ragged, and Isern’s hand tightening around her arm. ‘Or maybe I’d get my horse to fuck her. Or my dogs. Or … like, a pig, maybe?’\n\n\t\t\tThe older man sounded more than a touch disgusted. ‘How the hell would you do that?’\n\n\t\t\t‘There’s naught you can’t do if you’ve the imagination and the patience. Then I’ll bind her up in the trees with brambles where everyone can see, and cut the bloody cross in her, and put a bucket underneath to catch her guts, and send ’em to the other side.’\n\n\t\t\t‘What, her guts?’\n\n\t\t\t‘Aye, in a pretty box. Hardwood, nicely carved. With flowers, maybe. Or no! Herbs. So those old fools won’t smell what they’re getting till they open it.’ And he gave a satisfied grunt, like he was talking about a nice fish he’d catch, or a nice meal he’d eat, or a nice sit on the porch he couldn’t wait to have at sunset. ‘Imagine the looks on their faces.’ And he chuckled like her guts in a box would be quite the height of drollery.\n\n\t\t\t‘Fuck,’ breathed Rikke.\n\n\t\t\tIsern just whispered, ‘Shhhhhhhhh …’\n\n\t\t\t‘But that’s for later.’ And Nightfall gave a disappointed sigh. ‘Can’t cook what you haven’t caught, can you? My father’s offering a big gild for her, that’s sure. Whoever brings her in’ll be a wealthy man.’\n\n\t\t\tThe woman called Wonderful sounded like she was hardly enjoying this any more than Rikke was. ‘Right y’are, Chief. We’ll be looking.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Lovely. You can get back to your pissing now, Clover.’\n\n\t\t\t‘That’s all right. Won’t need another for a while, I reckon.’\n\n\t\t\tRikke heard soft footfalls moving away. Perhaps she should’ve been frozen with fear. The dead knew she’d a right to be. But what she felt instead was a boiling fury. A fury that warmed her through despite the icy water frothing to her chin. A fury that tempted her to slip from the stream with her knife between her teeth and cut the bloody cross in Stour Nightfall right then and there.\n\n\t\t\tRikke’s father had always told her vengeance was a waste of effort. That letting it go was the strong thing, the wise thing, the right thing. That blood only led to more blood. But his lessons seemed far away now, meant for a warmer place. She clenched her jaw, and narrowed her eyes, and swore to herself that if she lived out the week, she’d make it her business to see Stour Nightfall fucked by a pig.\n\n\t\t\t‘I’ll be honest, Wonderful,’ came the man’s voice, the one called Clover, speaking soft like he was sharing a secret, ‘I’m finding that bastard increasingly troubling.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Aye, I know.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Took it for an act at first, but I’m starting to think he’s everything he pretends to be.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Aye, I know.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Guts in a box? With herbs?’\n\n\t\t\t‘Aye, I know.’\n\n\t\t\t‘He’ll be king one o’ these days, will guts-in-a-box over yonder. King o’ the Northmen. Him.’\n\n\t\t\tA long pause, then a weary grunt. ‘It’s a thing no right-thinking person could look forward to.’\n\n\t\t\tRikke could only agree. She thought she saw a hint of their reflections, dancing among the black branches in the water.\n\n\t\t\t‘You see something down there?’\n\n\t\t\tShe stiffened, numb fingers curling tight around the grip of her knife. She saw the jaw muscles clench on the side of Isern’s face, blade of her spear sliding from the water, smeared with pitch so it wouldn’t catch the light.\n\n\t\t\t‘What? Fish?’\n\n\t\t\t‘Aye. Worth getting my rod, d’you think?’\n\n\t\t\tThe sound of Wonderful hawking up, then a glob of phlegm came spinning over from above and plopped into the water. ‘Nothing in this stream worth catching, I reckon.’\n\n\t\t \t\t\tIt Was Bad\n\n\t\t\tThe sun was setting when he came home, just a pink glimmer over black hills. The valley was in darkness but Broad could’ve walked the way blindfold. Knew every rut in the track, every stone in the tumbledown wall beside it.\n\n\t\t\tAll so familiar. But all so strange.\n\n\t\t\tAfter two years away, you’d think a man would run headlong towards a place he loved, the people he loved, with the biggest smile his cheeks could hold. But Broad trudged slow as the condemned to the scaffold, and smiled about as much, too. The man who left had feared nothing. The one coming back was scared all the time. He hardly even knew what of. Himself, maybe.\n\n\t\t\tWhen he saw the house, huddled among those bare trees, lamplight showing around the shutters, he had this strange urge to walk on. This strange thought he didn’t belong there any more. Not with what he’d seen. Not with what he’d done. What if he trod it in with him?\n\n\t\t\tBut the path leading past was a coward’s path. He clenched his aching fists. Gunnar Broad was no coward. Ask anyone.\n\n\t\t\tTook all the courage he had to knock on that door, though. More than it had to climb the ladders at Borletta, or lead the charge into those pikes at Musselia, or even carry those men dying of the grip in the long winter after. But he knocked.\n\n\t\t\t‘Who is it?’ Her voice, beyond the door, and it made him wince worse than the points of those pikes had. Till that moment, he’d been afraid she wouldn’t be there. That she’d have moved on. Forgotten him. Or maybe he’d been hoping she would’ve.\n\n\t\t\tHe could hardly find any voice at all. ‘It’s me, Liddy. It’s Gunnar.’\n\n\t\t\tThe door rattled open, and there she stood. She’d changed. Not near as much as he had, but she’d changed. Leaner, maybe. Harder, maybe. But when she smiled, it still lit the gloomy world, the way it always had.\n\n\t\t\t‘What are you doing knocking at your own door, you big fool?’\n\n\t\t\tAnd he just started crying. A jolting sob first that came all the way from his stomach. Then there was no stopping it. He fumbled his eye-lenses off with a trembling hand and all the tears he hadn’t shed in Styria, on account of Gunnar Broad being no coward, came burning down his crushed-up face.\n\n\t\t\tLiddy stepped forward and he shrank away, hunched and hurting, arms up as if to fend her off. Like she was made of glass and might shatter in his hands. She caught him even so. Thin arms, but a hold he couldn’t break, and though she was a head shorter than him, she held his face against her chest, and kissed his head, and whispered, ‘Shhhh, now. Shhhhh.’\n\n\t\t\tAfter a while, when his sobs started to calm, she put her hands on his cheeks and lifted his head so she was looking straight up at him, calm and serious.\n\n\t\t\t‘It was bad, then, was it?’ she asked him.\n\n\t\t\t‘Aye,’ he croaked out. ‘It was bad.’\n\n\t\t\tShe smiled. That smile that lit up the world. Close enough that even without his lenses he could actually see it. ‘But you’re home now.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Aye. I’m home now.’ And he set to crying again.\n\n\t\t\tThe thunk of the axe made Broad flinch. He told himself it was the sound of honest work done well. He told himself he was home, safe, far from the battlefield. But maybe he’d brought the battlefield home with him. Maybe the battlefield was whatever dirt he stood on now. He tried to hide it under a joke.\n\n\t\t\t‘I still say chopping wood is man’s work.’\n\n\t\t\tMay set another log on the block and hefted the axe. ‘When the men sod off to Styria, it all becomes women’s work.’\n\n\t\t\tWhen he left, she’d been boyish, quiet, awkward. As if her skin didn’t fit her. She was bony still, but there was a quick strength in the way she moved. She’d grown up fast. She’d had to. Another thunk and two more neat pieces of wood went tumbling.\n\n\t\t\t‘I should’ve stayed here and sent you off to fight,’ said Broad. ‘Maybe we’d have won.’\n\n\t\t\tMay smiled at him, and he smiled that he could make her smile, and wondered that someone who’d done all the bad he’d done could’ve had a hand in making something as good as she was.\n\n\t\t\t‘Where’d you get the lenses?’ she asked.\n\n\t\t\tBroad touched a finger to them. Sometimes forgot they were even on his face, till he took ’em off and everything beyond arm’s reach became a smudge. ‘I saved a man. Lord Marshal Mitterick.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Sounds fancy.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Commander o’ the army, no less. There was an ambush, and I happened to be there, and, well …’ He realised he’d bunched his fists trembling tight again and forced them open. ‘He thought I’d saved him. But I had to admit I’d no clue who he was till after the business was done, since I couldn’t see further than five strides. So he got me these as a gift.’ He took the lenses off, and breathed on them, and wiped them carefully with the hem of his shirt. ‘Probably cost six months of a soldier’s pay. Miracle o’ the modern age.’ And he hooked them back over his ears, and into the familiar groove across the bridge of his nose. ‘But I’m grateful, ’cause now I can appreciate my daughter’s beauty even halfway across the yard.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Beauty.’ And she gave a scornful snort but looked just a bit pleased at the same time. The sun broke through and was warm on Broad’s smile, and for a moment it was like it had been before. As if he never went.\n\n\t\t\t‘So you fought, then?’\n\n\t\t\tBroad’s mouth felt dry of a sudden. ‘I fought.’\n\n\t\t\t‘What was it like?’\n\n\t\t\t‘Well …’ All that time spent dreaming of her face and now she was looking right at him, it was hard to meet her eye. ‘It was bad.’\n\n\t\t\t‘I tell everyone my father’s a hero.’\n\n\t\t\tBroad winced. The clouds shifted and cast the yard into shadow, and the dread was at his shoulder again. ‘Don’t tell ’em that.’\n\n\t\t\t‘What should I tell ’em?’\n\n\t\t\tHe frowned down at his aching hands, rubbed at one with the other. ‘Not that.’\n\n\t\t\t‘What do the marks mean?’\n\n\t\t\tBroad tried to twitch his shirt cuff down over the Ladderman’s tattoo, but the blue stars on his knuckles still showed. ‘Just something the boys I was with did.’ And he slipped his hand behind him. Where May couldn’t see it. Where he didn’t have to.\n\n\t\t\t‘But—’\n\n\t\t\t‘Enough questions,’ said Liddy, stepping out onto the porch. ‘Your father just got back.’\n\n\t\t\t‘And I’ve got plenty to do,’ he said, standing. They must’ve been working hard to keep the house presentable, but it was too much for three, let alone two, looked like it was crumbling back into the land. ‘Must be half a dozen leaks to mend.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Be careful. Put your weight on the roof, I’ve a feeling the whole house might fall down.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Wouldn’t be surprised. I’ll check on our flock first, though. I hear the price for wool’s never better, what with all these new mills. They up the valley?’\n\n\t\t\tMay blinked over at her mother, and Liddy gave an odd kind of grimace, and Broad felt that dread pressing on him all the heavier. ‘What is it?’\n\n\t\t\t‘We don’t have a flock no more, Gunnar.’\n\n\t\t\t‘What?’\n\n\t\t\t‘I wanted to give you a proper night’s sleep without having to worry.’ Liddy heaved up a sigh seemed to come right from her worn shoes. ‘Lord Isher fenced the valley in. Said we couldn’t graze there any more.’\n\n\t\t\tBroad hardly understood what she was saying. ‘The valley’s common land. Always has been.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Not any more. King’s edict. It’s happening all over. Next valley, too. We had to sell the flock to him.’\n\n\t\t\t‘We had to sell him our sheep so he could graze ’em on our land?’\n\n\t\t\t‘He gave us a good price. Some lords didn’t give their tenants that much.’\n\n\t\t\t‘So I get fucked when I go to war and I get fucked when I come back?’ he snarled. The voice hardly sounded like his. ‘You didn’t … do anything?’\n\n\t\t\tLiddy’s eyes were hard. ‘I couldn’t think of anything to do. Maybe you could’ve, but you weren’t here.’\n\n\t\t\t‘None o’ this works without a flock!’ His father had raised sheep, and his grandfather, and his grandfather’s grandfather. Felt like the whole world had come unravelled. ‘What’ll we do?’ He found he’d clenched his fists again. He was shouting but he couldn’t stop. ‘What’ll we do?’\n\n\t\t\tAnd he saw May’s lip trembling like she was about to cry, and Liddy put an arm around her, and all the anger drained out of him and left him cold and desperate.\n\n\t\t\t‘I’m sorry.’ He’d sworn never to lose his temper again. Sworn he’d live for the two of them, give them a good life, and he’d fucked it up a few hours through the door. ‘I’m sorry.’ He took a step towards them, lifting a hand, then saw the tattoos on the knuckles and jerked it back.\n\n\t\t\tLiddy spoke soft and steady, looking him in the eye. ‘We’ve no choice, Gunnar. Isher offered to buy us out and we’ve got to go. Valbeck, I was thinking. There’s work in Valbeck. In the new mills.’\n\n\t\t\tBroad could only stare at her. And in the silence, he heard the sound of horses, and turned towards the track.\n\n\t\t\tThere were three men coming up it. Coming slow, like they had all day to get there. One on a big chestnut. Two on a wagon with a creaky wheel. Gunnar recognised the driver. Lennart Seldom, the miller’s younger brother. Broad had always reckoned him a coward and there was nothing in his shifty squint now to change his opinion.\n\n\t\t\t‘It’s Lennart Seldom,’ he muttered.\n\n\t\t\t‘It is,’ said Liddy. ‘May, get inside.’\n\n\t\t\t‘But Ma—’\n\n\t\t\t‘Inside.’\n\n\t\t\tThe other two, Broad didn’t know. A long, lean one sat by Seldom, swaying with the jolting of the cart, a big flatbow across his knees. Wasn’t loaded, which was a good thing, as they’d a habit of going off at the worst times, but Broad couldn’t see any reason for him to have it even so. A weapon for killing men. Or at least for threatening to.\n\n\t\t\tHe liked the look of the last rider even less. Big and bearded, with a fancy cavalry sword hanging low at his side, and a fancy three-cornered hat on his head, and a fancy way of sitting his saddle and looking around like this was his land.\n\n\t\t\tHe reined his horse in closer to the house than was polite, twisted his hat off, scrubbing at his flattened hair with his nails, considering Broad in thoughtful silence. Seldom brought the wagon to a halt behind him, between the two big lichen-spattered gateposts Gunnar’s grandfather had carved on the boundary.\n\n\t\t\t‘Gunnar,’ he said, shifty eyes flicking to Liddy and back.\n\n\t\t\t‘Seldom.’\n\n\t\t\tLiddy tidied a stray strand of hair behind her ear, and the wind took it right away and set it flicking about her worried face again.\n\n\t\t\t‘You’re back, then.’ If Seldom was trying to sound happy about it, he fell well short. ‘Where’d you get the lenses?’\n\n\t\t\t‘In Styria.’\n\n\t\t\t‘How was it?’\n\n\t\t\t‘Bad,’ said Broad.\n\n\t\t\t‘Looks like you lost weight.’\n\n\t\t\tThe one with the flatbow flashed a crooked grin. ‘How big did he use to be?’\n\n\t\t\t‘Even bigger,’ said the bearded one, barely giving Broad a glance as he settled his hat back on. ‘Evidently.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Too little food and too much shitting, I guess,’ said Broad.\n\n\t\t\t‘The soldier’s curse,’ said the bearded one. ‘Name’s Marsh.’ He bit the words off short like he didn’t care for talking and wanted to spend as little time at it as he could.\n\n\t\t\t‘I’m Able,’ said the thin one. ‘We work for Lord Isher.’\n\n\t\t\t‘What kind of work?’ asked Broad, though it was plain from the weapons.\n\n\t\t\t‘This and that. Buying up property, mostly. This is Isher’s valley—’\n\n\t\t\t‘This bit of it ain’t,’ said Broad.\n\n\t\t\tMarsh gave an unhappy grunt, stretched his chin forward to scratch at his beard.\n\n\t\t\t‘You can’t make a living here, Gunnar.’ Seldom gave a wheedling little chuckle. ‘You know that. Not now there’s no grazing. To be fair to Isher, the king’s hiked up his taxes neck high to pay for his bloody wars. There’s land getting fenced in all over. Worked with machines.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Efficiency,’ grunted Marsh, not even looking round.\n\n\t\t\tHis not caring a shit made Broad care all the more. ‘My father died on this land,’ he said, struggling to keep his voice down. ‘Fighting the Gurkish.’\n\n\t\t\t‘I know. Mine, too.’ Seldom shrugged. ‘But what can I do?’\n\n\t\t\t‘You just do what you’re told, eh?’\n\n\t\t\t‘If I don’t, someone else will.’\n\n\t\t\t‘Progress,’ grunted Marsh.\n\n\t\t\t‘Is it?’ Broad frowned up the valley, towards the other houses, all sitting quiet. He’d thought it was strange, that there was no smoke from the chimneys. ‘Turned all these others out already, did you? Lant and his daughters, and the Barrows, and Old Neiman?’\n\n\t\t\t‘Neiman died, but the rest sold up.’\n\n\t\t\t‘We made ’em see the sense in it,’ said Able, shifting that flatbow in his lap.\n\n\t\t\t‘So why’s my wife still here?’\n\n\t\t\tSeldom sneaked another shifty glance at Liddy. ‘Just wanted to give her some more time, ’cause we all know each other and—’\n\n\t\t\t‘You always liked her. I understand. I like her myself. That’s why I married her.’\n\n\t\t\tLiddy had a worried, warning note in her voice. ‘Gunnar—’\n\n\t\t\t‘Why she married me, I couldn’t say. But she did.’\n\n\t\t\tSeldom gave a watery effort at a smile. ‘Look, friend—’", "characters": [{"name": "Rikke", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Isern", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Stour Nightfall", "role": "ANTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Wonderful", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Clover", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Gunnar Broad", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Liddy", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "May", "role": "MINOR"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0042}}
{"story_id": "hyperion_scene_012", "text": "Colonel Fedmahn Kassad laughed softly. ‘The Ousters don’t want to occupy Hyperion,’ he said. ‘If they take the planet they’ll loot what they want and then do what they do best. They’ll burn the cities into charred rubble, break the rubble into smaller pieces, and then bake the pieces until they glow. They’ll melt the poles, boil the oceans, and then use the residue to salt what’s left of the continents so nothing will ever grow there again.’\n\n‘Well . . .’ began Father Hoyt and then trailed off.\n\nThere was no conversation as the clones cleared the soup and salad dishes and brought on the main course.\n\n‘You said that there was a Hegemony warship escorting us,’ the Consul said to Het Masteen as they finished their roast beef and boiled sky squid.\n\nThe Templar nodded and pointed. The Consul squinted but could make out nothing moving against the rotating starfield.\n\n‘Here,’ said Fedmahn Kassad and leaned across Father Hoyt to hand the Consul a collapsible pair of military binoculars.\n\nThe Consul nodded his thanks, thumbed on the power, and scanned the patch of sky Het Masteen had indicated. Gyroscopic crystals in the binoculars hummed slightly as they stabilized the optics and swept the area in a programmed search pattern. Suddenly the image froze, blurred, expanded, and steadied.\n\nThe Consul could not avoid an involuntary intake of breath as the Hegemony ship filled the viewer. Neither the expected field-blurred seed of a solo ramscout nor the bulb of a torchship, the electronically outlined image was of a matte-black attack carrier. The thing was impressive in the way only warships through the centuries had succeeded in being. The Hegemony spinship was incongruously streamlined with its four sets of boom arms retracted in battle readiness, its sixty-meter command probe sharp as a Clovis point, and its Hawking drive and fusion blisters set far back along the launch shaft like feathers on an arrow.\n\nThe Consul handed the binoculars back to Kassad without comment. If the task force was using a full attack carrier to escort the Yggdrasill, what kind of firepower were they setting in place to meet the Ouster invasion?\n\n‘How long until we land?’ asked Brawne Lamia. She had been using her comlog to access the treeship’s datasphere and obviously was frustrated with what she had found. Or had not found.\n\n‘Four hours until orbit,’ murmured Het Masteen. ‘A few minutes more by dropship. Our consular friend has offered his private craft to ferry you down.’\n\n‘To Keats?’ said Sol Weintraub. It was the first time the scholar had spoken since dinner had been served.\n\nThe Consul nodded. ‘It’s still the only spaceport on Hyperion set to handle passenger vehicles,’ he said.\n\n‘Spaceport?’ Father Hoyt sounded angry. ‘I thought that we were going straight to the north. To the Shrike’s realm.’\n\nHet Masteen patiently shook his head. ‘The pilgrimage always begins from the capital,’ he said. ‘It will take several days to reach the Time Tombs.’\n\n‘Several days,’ snapped Brawne Lamia. ‘That’s absurd.’\n\n‘Perhaps,’ agreed Het Masteen, ‘but it is the case, nonetheless.’\n\nFather Hoyt looked as if something in the meal had caused him indigestion even though he had eaten almost nothing. ‘Look,’ he said, ‘couldn’t we change the rules this once – I mean, given the war scare and all? And just land near the Time Tombs or wherever and get it over with?’\n\nThe Consul shook his head. ‘Spacecraft and aircraft have been trying to take the short route to the northern moors for almost four hundred years,’ he said. ‘I know of none who made it.’\n\n‘May one inquire,’ said Martin Silenus, happily raising his hand like a schoolboy, ‘just what the gibbering fuck happens to these legions of ships?’\n\nFather Hoyt frowned at the poet. Fedmahn Kassad smiled slightly. Sol Weintraub said, ‘The Consul did not mean to suggest that the area is inaccessible. One may travel by ship or various land routes. Nor do spacecraft and aircraft disappear. They easily land near the ruins or the Time Tombs and just as easily return to whatever point their computers command. It is merely the pilots and passengers who are never seen again.’ Weintraub lifted the sleeping baby from his lap and set her in an infant carrier slung around his neck.\n\n‘So the tired old legend goes,’ said Brawne Lamia. ‘What do the ship logs show?’\n\n‘Nothing,’ said the Consul. ‘No violence. No forced entry. No deviation from course. No unexplained time lapses. No unusual energy emissions or depletions. No physical phenomena of any sort.’\n\n‘No passengers,’ said Het Masteen.\n\nThe Consul did a slow double take. If Het Masteen had, indeed, just attempted a joke, it was the first sign in all of the Consul’s decades of dealing with the Templars that one of them had shown even a nascent sense of humour. What the Consul could see of the Captain’s vaguely oriental features beneath the cowl gave no hint that a joke had been attempted.\n\n‘Marvelous melodrama,’ laughed Silenus. ‘A real-life, Christ-weeping Sargasso of Souls and we’re for it. Who orchestrates this shitpot of a plot, anyway?’\n\n‘Shut up,’ said Brawne Lamia. ‘You’re drunk, old man.’\n\nThe Consul sighed. The group had been together for less than a standard hour.", "characters": [{"name": "Fedmahn Kassad", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Colonel Fedmahn Kassad"]}, {"name": "Hoyt", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Father Hoyt"]}, {"name": "The Consul", "role": "PROTAGONIST", "aliases": ["the Consul", "Consul"]}, {"name": "Het Masteen", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Brawne Lamia", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Sol Weintraub", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Martin Silenus", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.008}}
{"story_id": "hyperion_scene_013", "text": "‘Agreed,’ said the Consul, suddenly curious to hear the others tell their stories and equally sure that he would never tell his own. ‘Those in favor of telling our tales?’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Sol Weintraub.\n\n‘Yes,’ said Het Masteen.\n\n‘Absolutely,’ said Martin Silenus. ‘I wouldn’t miss this little comic farce for a month in the orgasm baths on Shote.’\n\n‘I vote yes also,’ said the Consul, surprising himself. ‘Those opposed?’\n\n‘Nay,’ said Father Hoyt but there was no energy in his voice.\n\n‘I think it’s stupid,’ said Brawne Lamia.\n\nThe Consul turned to Kassad. ‘Colonel?’\n\nFedmahn Kassad shrugged.\n\n‘I register four yes votes, two negatives, and one abstention,’ said the Consul. ‘The ayes have it. Who wants to start?’\n\nThe table was silent. Finally Martin Silenus looked up from where he had been writing on a small pad of paper. He tore a sheet into several smaller strips. ‘I’ve recorded numbers from one to seven,’ he said. ‘Why don’t we draw lots and go in the order we draw?’\n\n‘That seems rather childish, doesn’t it?’ said M. Lamia.\n\n‘I’m a childish fellow,’ responded Silenus with his satyr’s smile. ‘Ambassador’ – he nodded toward the Consul – ‘could I borrow that gilded pillow you’re wearing for a hat?’\n\nThe Consul handed over his tricorne, the folded slips were dropped in, and the hat passed around. Sol Weintraub was the first to draw, Martin Silenus the last.\n\nThe Consul unfolded his slip, making sure that no one else could see it. He was number seven. Tension ebbed out of him like air out of an overinflated balloon. It was quite possible, he reasoned, that events would intercede before he had to tell his story. Or the war would make everything academic. Or the group could lose interest in stories. Or the king could die. Or the horse could die. Or he could teach the horse how to talk.\n\nNo more whiskey, thought the Consul.\n\n‘Who’s first?’ asked Martin Silenus.\n\nIn the brief silence, the Consul could hear leaves stirring to unfelt breezes.\n\n‘I am,’ said Father Hoyt. The priest’s expression showed the same barely submerged acceptance of pain which the Consul had seen on the faces of terminally ill friends. Hoyt held up his slip of paper with a large 1 clearly scrawled on it.\n\n‘All right,’ said Silenus. ‘Start.’\n\n‘Now?’ asked the priest.\n\n‘Why not?’ said the poet. The only sign that Silenus had finished at least two bottles of wine was a slight darkening of the already ruddy cheeks and a somewhat more demonic tilt to the pitched eyebrows. ‘We have a few hours before planetfall,’ he said, ‘and I for one plan to sleep off the freezer fugue when we’re safely down and settled among the simple natives.’\n\n‘Our friend has a point,’ Sol Weintraub said softly. ‘If the tales are to be told, the hour after dinner each day is a civilized time to tell them.’\n\nFather Hoyt sighed and stood. ‘Just a minute,’ he said and left the dining platform.\n\nAfter some minutes had passed, Brawne Lamia said, ‘Do you think he’s lost his nerve?’\n\n‘No,’ said Lenar Hoyt, emerging from the darkness at the head of the wooden escalator which served as the main staircase. ‘I needed these.’ He dropped two small, stained notebooks on the table as he took his seat.\n\n‘No fair reading stories from a primer,’ said Silenus. ‘These are to be our own tall tales, Magus!’\n\n‘Shut up, damn it!’ cried Hoyt. He ran a hand across his face, touched his chest. For the second time that night, the Consul knew that he was looking at a seriously ill man.\n\n‘I’m sorry,’ said Father Hoyt. ‘But if I’m to tell my . . . my tale, I have to tell someone else’s story as well. These journals belong to the man who was the reason for my coming to Hyperion . . . and why I am returning today.’ Hoyt took a deep breath.\n\nThe Consul touched the journals. They were begrimed and charred, as if they had survived a fire. ‘Your friend has old-fashioned tastes,’ he said, ‘if he still keeps a written journal.’\n\n‘Yes,’ said Hoyt. ‘If you’re all ready, I will begin.’\n\nThe group at the table nodded. Beneath the dining platform, a kilometer of treeship drove through the cold night with the strong pulse of a living thing. Sol Weintraub lifted his sleeping child from the infant carrier and carefully set her on a cushioned mat on the floor near his chair. He removed his comlog, set it near the mat, and programmed the diskey for white noise. The week-old infant lay on her stomach and slept.\n\nThe Consul leaned far back and found the blue and green star which was Hyperion. It seemed to grow larger even as he watched. Het Masteen drew his cowl forward until only shadows showed for his face. Sol Weintraub lighted a pipe. Others accepted refills of coffee and settled back in their chairs.\n\nMartin Silenus seemed the most avid and expectant of the listeners as he leaned forward and whispered:‘He seyde, “Syn I shal bigynne the game,\n\nWhat, welcome be the cut, a Goddes name!\n\nNow lat us ryde, and herkneth what I seye.”\n\nAnd with that word we ryden forth oure weye;\n\nAnd he bigan with right a myrie cheere\n\nHis tale anon, and seyde as ye may heere.’\n\nTHE PRIEST’S TALE: ‘The Man Who Cried God’\n\n‘Sometimes there is a thin line separating orthodox zeal from apostasy,’ said Father Lenar Hoyt.\n\nSo began the priest’s story. Later, dictating the tale into his comlog, the Consul remembered it as a seamless whole, minus the pauses, hoarse voice, false starts, and small redundancies which were the timeless failings of human speech.\n\nLenar Hoyt had been a young priest, born, raised, and only recently ordained on the Catholic world of Pacem, when he was given his first offworld assignment: he was ordered to escort the respected Jesuit Father Paul Duré into quiet exile on the colony world of Hyperion.\n\nIn another time, Father Paul Duré certainly would have become a bishop and perhaps a pope. Tall, thin, ascetic, with white hair receding from a noble brow and eyes too filled with the sharp edge of experience to hide their pain, Paul Duré was a follower of St Teilhard as well as an archaeologist, ethnologist, and eminent Jesuit theologian. Despite the decline of the Catholic Church into what amounted to a half-forgotten cult tolerated because of its quaintness and isolation from the mainstream of Hegemony life, Jesuit logic had not lost its bite. Nor had Father Duré lost his conviction that the Holy Catholic Apostolic Church continued to be humankind’s last, best hope for immortality.\n\nTo Lenar Hoyt as a boy, Father Duré had been a somewhat godlike figure when glimpsed during his rare visits to the pre-seminary schools, or on the would-be seminarian’s even rarer visits to the New Vatican. Then, during the years of Hoyt’s study in seminary, Duré had been on an important Church-sponsored archaeological dig on the nearby world of Armaghast. When the Jesuit returned, a few weeks after Hoyt’s ordination, it had been under a cloud. No one outside the highest circles of the New Vatican knew precisely what had happened, but there were whispers of excommunication and even of a hearing before the Holy Office of the Inquisition, dormant the four centuries since the confusion following the death of Earth.", "characters": [{"name": "The Consul", "role": "PROTAGONIST", "aliases": ["the Consul", "Consul"]}, {"name": "Sol Weintraub", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Het Masteen", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Martin Silenus", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Lenar Hoyt", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Father Lenar Hoyt"]}, {"name": "Brawne Lamia", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Fedmahn Kassad", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Paul Duré", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Father Paul Duré", "Father Duré", "Duré"]}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0064}}

{"story_id": "gone_girl_scene_a", "text": "When I think of my wife, I always think of her head. The shape of it, to begin with. The very first time I saw her, it was the back of the head I saw, and there was something lovely about it, the angles of it. Like a shiny, hard corn kernel or a riverbed fossil. She had what the Victorians would call a finely shaped head. You could imagine the skull quite easily.\n\nI’d know her head anywhere.\n\nAnd what’s inside it. I think of that too: her mind. Her brain, all those coils, and her thoughts shuttling through those coils like fast, frantic centipedes. Like a child, I picture opening her skull, unspooling her brain and sifting through it, trying to catch and pin down her thoughts. What are you thinking, Amy? The question I’ve asked most often during our marriage, if not out loud, if not to the person who could answer. I suppose these questions stormcloud over every marriage: What are you thinking? How are you feeling? Who are you? What have we done to each other? What will we do?\n\nMy eyes flipped open at exactly six A.M. This was no avian fluttering of the lashes, no gentle blink toward consciousness. The awakening was mechanical. A spooky ventriloquist-dummy click of the lids: The world is black and then, showtime! 6-0-0 the clock said—in my face, first thing I saw. 6-0-0. It felt different. I rarely woke at such a rounded time. I was a man of jagged risings: 8:43, 11:51, 9:26. My life was alarmless.\n\nAt that exact moment, 6-0-0, the sun climbed over the skyline of oaks, revealing its full summer angry-god self. Its reflection flared across the river toward our house, a long, blaring finger aimed at me through our frail bedroom curtains. Accusing: You have been seen. You will be seen.\n\nI wallowed in bed, which was our New York bed in our new house, which we still called the new house, even though we’d been back here for two years. It’s a rented house right along the Mississippi River, a house that screams Suburban Nouveau Riche, the kind of place I aspired to as a kid from my split-level, shag-carpet side of town. The kind of house that is immediately familiar: a generically grand, unchallenging, new, new, new house that my wife would—and did—detest.\n\n“Should I remove my soul before I come inside?” Her first line upon arrival. It had been a compromise: Amy demanded we rent, not buy, in my little Missouri hometown, in her firm hope that we wouldn’t be stuck here long. But the only houses for rent were clustered in this failed development: a miniature ghost town of bank-owned, recession-busted, price-reduced mansions, a neighborhood that closed before it ever opened. It was a compromise, but Amy didn’t see it that way, not in the least. To Amy, it was a punishing whim on my part, a nasty, selfish twist of the knife. I would drag her, caveman-style, to a town she had aggressively avoided, and make her live in the kind of house she used to mock. I suppose it’s not a compromise if only one of you considers it such, but that was what our compromises tended to look like. One of us was always angry. Amy, usually.\n\nDo not blame me for this particular grievance, Amy. The Missouri Grievance. Blame the economy, blame bad luck, blame my parents, blame your parents, blame the Internet, blame people who use the Internet. I used to be a writer. I was a writer who wrote about TV and movies and books. Back when people read things on paper, back when anyone cared about what I thought. I’d arrived in New York in the late ’90s, the last gasp of the glory days, although no one knew it then. New York was packed with writers, real writers, because there were magazines, real magazines, loads of them. This was back when the Internet was still some exotic pet kept in the corner of the publishing world—throw some kibble at it, watch it dance on its little leash, oh quite cute, it definitely won’t kill us in the night. Think about it: a time when newly graduated college kids could come to New York and get paid to write. We had no clue that we were embarking on careers that would vanish within a decade.\n\nI had a job for eleven years and then I didn’t, it was that fast. All around the country, magazines began shuttering, succumbing to a sudden infection brought on by the busted economy. Writers (my kind of writers: aspiring novelists, ruminative thinkers, people whose brains don’t work quick enough to blog or link or tweet, basically old, stubborn blowhards) were through. We were like women’s hat makers or buggy-whip manufacturers: Our time was done. Three weeks after I got cut loose, Amy lost her job, such as it was. (Now I can feel Amy looking over my shoulder, smirking at the time I’ve spent discussing my career, my misfortune, and dismissing her experience in one sentence. That, she would tell you, is typical. Just like Nick, she would say. It was a refrain of hers: Just like Nick to … and whatever followed, whatever was just like me, was bad.) Two jobless grown-ups, we spent weeks wandering around our Brooklyn brownstone in socks and pajamas, ignoring the future, strewing unopened mail across tables and sofas, eating ice cream at ten A.M. and taking thick afternoon naps.\n\nThen one day the phone rang. My twin sister was on the other end. Margo had moved back home after her own New York layoff a year before—the girl is one step ahead of me in everything, even shitty luck. Margo, calling from good ole North Carthage, Missouri, from the house where we grew up, and as I listened to her voice, I saw her at age ten, with a dark cap of hair and overall shorts, sitting on our grandparents’ back dock, her body slouched over like an old pillow, her skinny legs dangling in the water, watching the river flow over fish-white feet, so intently, utterly self-possessed even as a child.\n\nGo’s voice was warm and crinkly even as she gave this cold news: Our indomitable mother was dying. Our dad was nearly gone—his (nasty) mind, his (miserable) heart, both murky as he meandered toward the great gray beyond. But it looked like our mother would beat him there. About six months, maybe a year, she had. I could tell that Go had gone to meet with the doctor by herself, taken her studious notes in her slovenly handwriting, and she was teary as she tried to decipher what she’d written. Dates and doses.\n\n“Well, fuck, I have no idea what this says, is it a nine? Does that even make sense?” she said, and I interrupted. Here was a task, a purpose, held out on my sister’s palm like a plum. I almost cried with relief.\n\n“I’ll come back, Go. We’ll move back home. You shouldn’t have to do this all by yourself.”\n\nShe didn’t believe me. I could hear her breathing on the other end.\n\n“I’m serious, Go. Why not? There’s nothing here.”\n\nA long exhale. “What about Amy?”\n\nThat is what I didn’t take long enough to consider. I simply assumed I would bundle up my New York wife with her New York interests, her New York pride, and remove her from her New York parents—leave the frantic, thrilling futureland of Manhattan behind—and transplant her to a little town on the river in Missouri, and all would be fine.\n\nI did not yet understand how foolish, how optimistic, how, yes, just like Nick I was for thinking this. The misery it would lead to.\n\n“Amy will be fine. Amy …” Here was where I should have said, “Amy loves Mom.” But I couldn’t tell Go that Amy loved our mother, because after all that time, Amy still barely knew our mother. Their few meetings had left them both baffled. Amy would dissect the conversations for days after—“And what did she mean by …”—as if my mother were some ancient peasant tribeswoman arriving from the tundra with an armful of raw yak meat and some buttons for bartering, trying to get something from Amy that wasn’t on offer.\n\nAmy didn’t care to know my family, didn’t want to know my birthplace, and yet for some reason, I thought moving home would be a good idea.\n\nMy morning breath warmed the pillow, and I changed the subject in my mind. Today was not a day for second-guessing or regret, it was a day for doing. Downstairs, I could hear the return of a long-lost sound: Amy making breakfast. Banging wooden cupboards (rump-thump!), rattling containers of tin and glass (ding-ring!), shuffling and sorting a collection of metal pots and iron pans (ruzz-shuzz!). A culinary orchestra tuning up, clattering vigorously toward the finale, a cake pan drumrolling along the floor, hitting the wall with a cymballic crash. Something impressive was being created, probably a crepe, because crepes are special, and today Amy would want to cook something special.\n\nIt was our five-year anniversary.\n\nI walked barefoot to the edge of the steps and stood listening, working my toes into the plush wall-to-wall carpet Amy detested on principle, as I tried to decide whether I was ready to join my wife. Amy was in the kitchen, oblivious to my hesitation. She was humming something melancholy and familiar. I strained to make it out—a folk song? a lullabye?—and then realized it was the theme to M*A*S*H. Suicide is painless. I went downstairs.\n\nI hovered in the doorway, watching my wife. Her yellow-butter hair was pulled up, the hank of ponytail swinging cheerful as a jump-rope, and she was sucking distractedly on a burnt fingertip, humming around it. She hummed to herself because she was an unrivaled botcher of lyrics. When we were first dating, a Genesis song came on the radio: “She seems to have an invisible touch, yeah.” And Amy crooned instead, “She takes my hat and puts it on the top shelf.” When I asked her why she’d ever think her lyrics were remotely, possibly, vaguely right, she told me she always thought the woman in the song truly loved the man because she put his hat on the top shelf. I knew I liked her then, really liked her, this girl with an explanation for everything.\n\nThere’s something disturbing about recalling a warm memory and feeling utterly cold.\n\nAmy peered at the crepe sizzling in the pan and licked something off her wrist. She looked triumphant, wifely. If I took her in my arms, she would smell like berries and powdered sugar.\n\nWhen she spied me lurking there in grubby boxers, my hair in full Heat Miser spike, she leaned against the kitchen counter and said, “Well, hello, handsome.”\n\nBile and dread inched up my throat. I thought to myself: Okay, go.\n\nI was very late getting to work. My sister and I had done a foolish thing when we both moved back home. We had done what we always talked about doing. We opened a bar. We borrowed money from Amy to do this, eighty thousand dollars, which was once nothing to Amy but by then was almost everything. I swore I would pay her back, with interest. I would not be a man who borrowed from his wife—I could feel my dad twisting his lips at the very idea. Well, there are all kinds of men, his most damning phrase, the second half left unsaid, and you are the wrong kind.\n\nBut truly, it was a practical decision, a smart business move. Amy and I both needed new careers; this would be mine. She would pick one someday, or not, but in the meantime, here was an income, made possible by the last of Amy’s trust fund. Like the McMansion I rented, the bar featured symbolically in my childhood memories—a place where only grown-ups go, and do whatever grown-ups do. Maybe that’s why I was so insistent on buying it after being stripped of my livelihood. It’s a reminder that I am, after all, an adult, a grown man, a useful human being, even though I lost the career that made me all these things. I won’t make that mistake again: The once plentiful herds of magazine writers would continue to be culled—by the Internet, by the recession, by the American public, who would rather watch TV or play video games or electronically inform friends that, like, rain sucks! But there’s no app for a bourbon buzz on a warm day in a cool, dark bar. The world will always want a drink.\n\nOur bar is a corner bar with a haphazard, patchwork aesthetic. Its best feature is a massive Victorian backbar, dragon heads and angel faces emerging from the oak—an extravagant work of wood in these shitty plastic days. The remainder of the bar is, in fact, shitty, a showcase of the shabbiest design offerings of every decade: an Eisenhower-era linoleum floor, the edges turned up like burnt toast; dubious wood-paneled walls straight from a ’70s home-porn video; halogen floor lamps, an accidental tribute to my 1990s dorm room. The ultimate effect is strangely homey—it looks less like a bar than someone’s benignly neglected fixer-upper. And jovial: We share a parking lot with the local bowling alley, and when our door swings wide, the clatter of strikes applauds the customer’s entrance.\n\nWe named the bar The Bar. “People will think we’re ironic instead of creatively bankrupt,” my sister reasoned.\n\nYes, we thought we were being clever New Yorkers—that the name was a joke no one else would really get, not get like we did. Not meta-get. We pictured the locals scrunching their noses: Why’d you name it The Bar? But our first customer, a gray-haired woman in bifocals and a pink jogging suit, said, “I like the name. Like in Breakfast at Tiffany’s and Audrey Hepburn’s cat was named Cat.”\n\nWe felt much less superior after that, which was a good thing.\n\nI pulled into the parking lot. I waited until a strike erupted from the bowling alley—thank you, thank you, friends—then stepped out of the car. I admired the surroundings, still not bored with the broken-in view: the squatty blond-brick post office across the street (now closed on Saturdays), the unassuming beige office building just down the way (now closed, period). The town wasn’t prosperous, not anymore, not by a long shot. Hell, it wasn’t even original, being one of two Carthage, Missouris—ours is technically North Carthage, which makes it sound like a twin city, although it’s hundreds of miles from the other and the lesser of the two: a quaint little 1950s town that bloated itself into a basic midsize suburb and dubbed it progress. Still, it was where my mom grew up and where she raised me and Go, so it had some history. Mine, at least.\n\nAs I walked toward the bar across the concrete-and-weed parking lot, I looked straight down the road and saw the river. That’s what I’ve always loved about our town: We aren’t built on some safe bluff overlooking the Mississippi—we are on the Mississippi. I could walk down the road and step right into the sucker, an easy three-foot drop, and be on my way to Tennessee. Every building downtown bears hand-drawn lines from where the river hit during the Flood of ’61, ’75, ’84, ’93, ’07, ’08, ’11. And so on.\n\nThe river wasn’t swollen now, but it was running urgently, in strong ropy currents. Moving apace with the river was a long single-file line of men, eyes aimed at their feet, shoulders tense, walking steadfastly nowhere. As I watched them, one suddenly looked up at me, his face in shadow, an oval blackness. I turned away.\n\nI felt an immediate, intense need to get inside. By the time I’d gone twenty feet, my neck bubbled with sweat. The sun was still an angry eye in the sky. You have been seen.\n\nMy gut twisted, and I moved quicker. I needed a drink.\n\n\n\n\n\nAMY ELLIOTT\n\nJANUARY 8, 2005\n\n\nDIARY ENTRY\n\nTra and la! I am smiling a big adopted-orphan smile as I write this. I am embarrassed at how happy I am, like some Technicolor comic of a teenage girl talking on the phone with my hair in a ponytail, the bubble above my head saying: I met a boy!\n\nBut I did. This is a technical, empirical truth. I met a boy, a great, gorgeous dude, a funny, cool-ass guy. Let me set the scene, because it deserves setting for posterity (no, please, I’m not that far gone, posterity! feh). But still. It’s not New Year’s, but still very much the new year. It’s winter: early dark, freezing cold.\n\nCarmen, a newish friend—semi-friend, barely friend, the kind of friend you can’t cancel on—has talked me into going out to Brooklyn, to one of her writers’ parties. Now, I like a writer party, I like writers, I am the child of writers, I am a writer. I still love scribbling that word—WRITER—anytime a form, questionnaire, document asks for my occupation. Fine, I write personality quizzes, I don’t write about the Great Issues of the Day, but I think it’s fair to say I am a writer. I’m using this journal to get better: to hone my skills, to collect details and observations. To show don’t tell and all that other writery crap. (Adopted-orphan smile, I mean, that’s not bad, come on.) But really, I do think my quizzes alone qualify me on at least an honorary basis. Right?\n\nAt a party you find yourself surrounded by genuine talented writers, employed at high-profile, respected newspapers and magazines. You merely write quizzes for women’s rags. When someone asks what you do for a living, you:\n\na) Get embarrassed and say, “I’m just a quiz writer, it’s silly stuff!”\n\nb) Go on the offense: “I’m a writer now, but I’m considering something more challenging and worthwhile—why, what do you do?”\n\nc) Take pride in your accomplishments: “I write personality quizzes using the knowledge gleaned from my master’s degree in psychology—oh, and fun fact: I am the inspiration for a beloved children’s-book series, I’m sure you know it, Amazing Amy? Yeah, so suck it, snobdouche!\n\nAnswer: C, totally C\n\n\n\nAnyway, the party is being thrown by one of Carmen’s good friends who writes about movies for a movie magazine, and is very funny, according to Carmen. I worry for a second that she wants to set us up: I am not interested in being set up. I need to be ambushed, caught unawares, like some sort of feral love-jackal. I’m too self-conscious otherwise. I feel myself trying to be charming, and then I realize I’m obviously trying to be charming, and then I try to be even more charming to make up for the fake charm, and then I’ve basically turned into Liza Minnelli: I’m dancing in tights and sequins, begging you to love me. There’s a bowler and jazz hands and lots of teeth.\n\nBut no, I realize, as Carmen gushes on about her friend: She likes him. Good.\n\nWe climb three flights of warped stairs and walk into a whoosh of body heat and writerness: many black-framed glasses and mops of hair; faux western shirts and heathery turtlenecks; black wool pea-coats flopped all across the couch, puddling to the floor; a German poster for The Getaway (Ihre Chance war gleich Null!) covering one paint-cracked wall. Franz Ferdinand on the stereo: “Take Me Out.”\n\nA clump of guys hovers near a card table where all the alcohol is set up, tipping more booze into their cups after every few sips, all too aware of how little is left to go around. I nudge in, aiming my plastic cup in the center like a busker, get a clatter of ice cubes and a splash of vodka from a sweet-faced guy wearing a Space Invaders T-shirt.\n\nA lethal-looking bottle of green-apple liqueur, the host’s ironic purchase, will soon be our fate unless someone makes a booze run, and that seems unlikely, as everyone clearly believes they made the run last time. It is a January party, definitely, everyone still glutted and sugar-pissed from the holidays, lazy and irritated simultaneously. A party where people drink too much and pick cleverly worded fights, blowing cigarette smoke out an open window even after the host asks them to go outside. We’ve already talked to one another at a thousand holiday parties, we have nothing left to say, we are collectively bored, but we don’t want to go back into the January cold; our bones still ache from the subway steps.\n\nI have lost Carmen to her host-beau—they are having an intense discussion in a corner of the kitchen, the two of them hunching their shoulders, their faces toward each other, the shape of a heart. Good. I think about eating to give myself something to do besides standing in the center of the room, smiling like the new kid in the lunchroom. But almost everything is gone. Some potato-chip shards sit in the bottom of a giant Tupperware bowl. A supermarket deli tray full of hoary carrots and gnarled celery and a semeny dip sits untouched on a coffee table, cigarettes littered throughout like bonus vegetable sticks. I am doing my thing, my impulse thing: What if I leap from the theater balcony right now? What if I tongue the homeless man across from me on the subway? What if I sit down on the floor of this party by myself and eat everything on that deli tray, including the cigarettes?\n\n“Please don’t eat anything in that area,” he says. It is him (bum bum BUMMM!), but I don’t yet know it’s him (bum-bum-bummm). I know it’s a guy who will talk to me, he wears his cockiness like an ironic T-shirt, but it fits him better. He is the kind of guy who carries himself like he gets laid a lot, a guy who likes women, a guy who would actually fuck me properly. I would like to be fucked properly! My dating life seems to rotate around three types of men: preppy Ivy Leaguers who believe they’re characters in a Fitzgerald novel; slick Wall Streeters with money signs in their eyes, their ears, their mouths; and sensitive smart-boys who are so self-aware that everything feels like a joke. The Fitzgerald fellows tend to be ineffectively porny in bed, a lot of noise and acrobatics to very little end. The finance guys turn rageful and flaccid. The smart-boys fuck like they’re composing a piece of math rock: This hand strums around here, and then this finger offers a nice bass rhythm.… I sound quite slutty, don’t I? Pause while I count how many … eleven. Not bad. I’ve always thought twelve was a solid, reasonable number to end at.\n\n“Seriously,” Number 12 continues. (Ha!) “Back away from the tray. James has up to three other food items in his refrigerator. I could make you an olive with mustard. Just one olive, though.”\n\nJust one olive, though. It is a line that is only a little funny, but it already has the feel of an inside joke, one that will get funnier with nostalgic repetition. I think: A year from now, we will be walking along the Brooklyn Bridge at sunset and one of us will whisper, “Just one olive, though,” and we’ll start to laugh. (Then I catch myself. Awful. If he knew I was doing a year from now already, he’d run and I’d be obliged to cheer him on.)\n\nMainly, I will admit, I smile because he’s gorgeous. Distractingly gorgeous, the kind of looks that make your eyes pinwheel, that make you want to just address the elephant—“You know you’re gorgeous, right?”—and move on with the conversation. I bet dudes hate him: He looks like the rich-boy villain in an ’80s teen movie—the one who bullies the sensitive misfit, the one who will end up with a pie in the puss, the whipped cream wilting his upturned collar as everyone in the cafeteria cheers.\n\nHe doesn’t act that way, though. His name is Nick. I love it. It makes him seem nice, and regular, which he is. When he tells me his name, I say, “Now, that’s a real name.” He brightens and reels off some line: “Nick’s the kind of guy you can drink a beer with, the kind of guy who doesn’t mind if you puke in his car. Nick!”\n\nHe makes a series of awful puns. I catch three-fourths of his movie references. Two-thirds, maybe. (Note to self: Rent The Sure Thing.) He refills my drink without me having to ask, somehow ferreting out one last cup of the good stuff. He has claimed me, placed a flag in me: I was here first, she’s mine, mine. It feels nice, after my recent series of nervous, respectful post-feminist men, to be a territory. He has a great smile, a cat’s smile. He should cough out yellow Tweety Bird feathers, the way he smiles at me. He doesn’t ask what I do for a living, which is fine, which is a change. (I’m a writer, did I mention?) He talks to me in his river-wavy Missouri accent; he was born and raised outside of Hannibal, the boyhood home of Mark Twain, the inspiration for Tom Sawyer. He tells me he worked on a steamboat when he was a teenager, dinner and jazz for the tourists. And when I laugh (bratty, bratty New York girl who has never ventured to those big unwieldy middle states, those States Where Many Other People Live), he informs me that Missoura is a magical place, the most beautiful in the world, no state more glorious. His eyes are mischievous, his lashes are long. I can see what he looked like as a boy.\n\nWe share a taxi home, the streetlights making dizzy shadows and the car speeding as if we’re being chased. It is one A.M. when we hit one of New York’s unexplained deadlocks twelve blocks from my apartment, so we slide out of the taxi into the cold, into the great What Next? and Nick starts walking me home, his hand on the small of my back, our faces stunned by the chill. As we turn the corner, the local bakery is getting its powdered sugar delivered, funneled into the cellar by the barrelful as if it were cement, and we can see nothing but the shadows of the deliverymen in the white, sweet cloud. The street is billowing, and Nick pulls me close and smiles that smile again, and he takes a single lock of my hair between two fingers and runs them all the way to the end, tugging twice, like he’s ringing a bell. His eyelashes are trimmed with powder, and before he leans in, he brushes the sugar from my lips so he can taste me.", "characters": [{"name": "Nick", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Amy Elliott", "role": "PROTAGONIST", "aliases": ["Amy"]}, {"name": "Margo", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Go"]}, {"name": "Carmen", "role": "MINOR"}, {"name": "James", "role": "MINOR"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0011}}
{"story_id": "gone_girl_scene_b", "text": "I swung wide the door of my bar, slipped into the darkness, and took my first real deep breath of the day, took in the smell of cigarettes and beer, the spice of a dribbled bourbon, the tang of old popcorn. There was only one customer in the bar, sitting by herself at the far, far end: an older woman named Sue who had come in every Thursday with her husband until he died three months back. Now she came alone every Thursday, never much for conversation, just sitting with a beer and a crossword, preserving a ritual.\n\nMy sister was at work behind the bar, her hair pulled back in nerdy-girl barrettes, her arms pink as she dipped the beer glasses in and out of hot suds. Go is slender and strange-faced, which is not to say unattractive. Her features just take a moment to make sense: the broad jaw; the pinched, pretty nose; the dark globe eyes. If this were a period movie, a man would tilt back his fedora, whistle at the sight of her, and say, “Now, there’s a helluva broad!” The face of a ’30s screwball-movie queen doesn’t always translate in our pixie-princess times, but I know from our years together that men like my sister, a lot, which puts me in that strange brotherly realm of being both proud and wary.\n\n“Do they still make pimento loaf?” she said by way of greeting, not looking up, just knowing it was me, and I felt the relief I usually felt when I saw her: Things might not be great, but things would be okay.\n\nMy twin, Go. I’ve said this phrase so many times, it has become a reassuring mantra instead of actual words: Mytwingo. We were born in the ’70s, back when twins were rare, a bit magical: cousins of the unicorn, siblings of the elves. We even have a dash of twin telepathy. Go is truly the one person in the entire world I am totally myself with. I don’t feel the need to explain my actions to her. I don’t clarify, I don’t doubt, I don’t worry. I don’t tell her everything, not anymore, but I tell her more than anyone else, by far. I tell her as much as I can. We spent nine months back to back, covering each other. It became a lifelong habit. It never mattered to me that she was a girl, strange for a deeply self-conscious kid. What can I say? She was always just cool.\n\n“Pimento loaf, that’s like lunch meat, right? I think they do.”\n\n“We should get some,” she said. She arched an eyebrow at me. “I’m intrigued.”\n\nWithout asking, she poured me a draft of PBR into a mug of questionable cleanliness. When she caught me staring at the smudged rim, she brought the glass up to her mouth and licked the smudge away, leaving a smear of saliva. She set the mug squarely in front of me. “Better, my prince?”\n\nGo firmly believes that I got the best of everything from our parents, that I was the boy they planned on, the single child they could afford, and that she sneaked into this world by clamping onto my ankle, an unwanted stranger. (For my dad, a particularly unwanted stranger.) She believes she was left to fend for herself throughout childhood, a pitiful creature of random hand-me-downs and forgotten permission slips, tightened budgets and general regret. This vision could be somewhat true; I can barely stand to admit it.\n\n“Yes, my squalid little serf,” I said, and fluttered my hands in royal dispensation.\n\nI huddled over my beer. I needed to sit and drink a beer or three. My nerves were still singing from the morning.\n\n“What’s up with you?” she asked. “You look all twitchy.” She flicked some suds at me, more water than soap. The air-conditioning kicked on, ruffling the tops of our heads. We spent more time in The Bar than we needed to. It had become the childhood clubhouse we never had. We’d busted open the storage boxes in our mother’s basement one drunken night last year, back when she was alive but right near the end, when we were in need of comfort, and we revisited the toys and games with much oohing and ahhing between sips of canned beer. Christmas in August. After Mom died, Go moved into our old house, and we slowly relocated our toys, piecemeal, to The Bar: a Strawberry Shortcake doll, now scentless, pops up on a stool one day (my gift to Go). A tiny Hot Wheels El Camino, one wheel missing, appears on a shelf in the corner (Go’s to me).\n\nWe were thinking of introducing a board game night, even though most of our customers were too old to be nostalgic for our Hungry Hungry Hippos, our Game of Life with its tiny plastic cars to be filled with tiny plastic pinhead spouses and tiny plastic pinhead babies. I couldn’t remember how you won. (Deep Hasbro thought for the day.)\n\nGo refilled my beer, refilled her beer. Her left eyelid drooped slightly. It was exactly noon, 12:00, and I wondered how long she’d been drinking. She’s had a bumpy decade. My speculative sister, she of the rocket-science brain and the rodeo spirit, dropped out of college and moved to Manhattan in the late ’90s. She was one of the original dot-com phenoms—made crazy money for two years, then took the Internet bubble bath in 2000. Go remained unflappable. She was closer to twenty than thirty; she was fine. For act two, she got her degree and joined the gray-suited world of investment banking. She was midlevel, nothing flashy, nothing blameful, but she lost her job—fast—with the 2008 financial meltdown. I didn’t even know she’d left New York until she phoned me from Mom’s house: I give up. I begged her, cajoled her to return, hearing nothing but peeved silence on the other end. After I hung up, I made an anxious pilgrimage to her apartment in the Bowery and saw Gary, her beloved ficus tree, yellow-dead on the fire escape, and knew she’d never come back.\n\nThe Bar seemed to cheer her up. She handled the books, she poured the beers. She stole from the tip jar semi-regularly, but then she did more work than me. We never talked about our old lives. We were Dunnes, and we were done, and strangely content about it.\n\n“So, what?” Go said, her usual way of beginning a conversation.\n\n“Eh.”\n\n“Eh, what? Eh, bad? You look bad.”\n\nI shrugged a yes; she scanned my face.\n\n“Amy?” she asked. It was an easy question. I shrugged again—a confirmation this time, a whatcha gonna do? shrug.\n\nGo gave me her amused face, both elbows on the bar, hands cradling chin, hunkering down for an incisive dissection of my marriage. Go, an expert panel of one. “What about her?”\n\n“Bad day. It’s just a bad day.”\n\n“Don’t let her worry you.” Go lit a cigarette. She smoked exactly one a day. “Women are crazy.” Go didn’t consider herself part of the general category of women, a word she used derisively.\n\nI blew Go’s smoke back to its owner. “It’s our anniversary today. Five years.”\n\n“Wow.” My sister cocked her head back. She’d been a bridesmaid, all in violet—“the gorgeous, raven-haired, amethyst-draped dame,” Amy’s mother had dubbed her—but anniversaries weren’t something she’d remember. “Jeez. Fuck. Dude. That came fast.” She blew more smoke toward me, a lazy game of cancer catch. “She going to do one of her, uh, what do you call it, not scavenger hunt—”\n\n“Treasure hunt,” I said.\n\nMy wife loved games, mostly mind games, but also actual games of amusement, and for our anniversary she always set up an elaborate treasure hunt, with each clue leading to the hiding place of the next clue until I reached the end, and my present. It was what her dad always did for her mom on their anniversary, and don’t think I don’t see the gender roles here, that I don’t get the hint. But I did not grow up in Amy’s household, I grew up in mine, and the last present I remember my dad giving my mom was an iron, set on the kitchen counter, no wrapping paper.\n\n“Should we make a wager on how pissed she’s going to get at you this year?” Go asked, smiling over the rim of her beer.\n\nThe problem with Amy’s treasure hunts: I never figured out the clues. Our first anniversary, back in New York, I went two for seven. That was my best year. The opening parley:\n\nThis place is a bit of a hole in the wall,\n\nBut we had a great kiss there one Tuesday last fall.\n\n\n\nEver been in a spelling bee as a kid? That snowy second after the announcement of the word as you sift your brain to see if you can spell it? It was like that, the blank panic.\n\n“An Irish bar in a not-so-Irish place,” Amy nudged.\n\nI bit the side of my lip, started a shrug, scanning our living room as if the answer might appear. She gave me another very long minute.\n\n“We were lost in the rain,” she said in a voice that was pleading on the way to peeved.\n\nI finished the shrug.\n\n“McMann’s, Nick. Remember, when we got lost in the rain in Chinatown trying to find that dim sum place, and it was supposed to be near the statue of Confucius but it turns out there are two statues of Confucius, and we ended up at that random Irish bar all soaking wet, and we slammed a few whiskeys, and you grabbed me and kissed me, and it was—”\n\n“Right! You should have done a clue with Confucius, I would have gotten that.”\n\n“The statue wasn’t the point. The place was the point. The moment. I just thought it was special.” She said these last words in a childish lilt that I once found fetching.\n\n“It was special.” I pulled her to me and kissed her. “That smooch right there was my special anniversary reenactment. Let’s go do it again at McMann’s.”\n\nAt McMann’s, the bartender, a big, bearded bear-kid, saw us come in and grinned, poured us both whiskeys, and pushed over the next clue.\n\nWhen I’m down and feeling blue\n\nThere’s only one place that will do.\n\n\n\nThat one turned out to be the Alice in Wonderland statue at Central Park, which Amy had told me—she’d told me, she knew she’d told me many times—lightened her moods as a child. I do not remember any of those conversations. I’m being honest here, I just don’t. I have a dash of ADD, and I’ve always found my wife a bit dazzling, in the purest sense of the word: to lose clear vision, especially from looking at bright light. It was enough to be near her and hear her talk, it didn’t always matter what she was saying. It should have, but it didn’t.\n\nBy the time we got to the end of the day, to exchanging our actual presents—the traditional paper presents for the first year of marriage—Amy was not speaking to me.\n\n“I love you, Amy. You know I love you,” I said, tailing her in and out of the family packs of dazed tourists parked in the middle of the sidewalk, oblivious and openmouthed. Amy was slipping through the Central Park crowds, maneuvering between laser-eyed joggers and scissor-legged skaters, kneeling parents and toddlers careering like drunks, always just ahead of me, tight-lipped, hurrying nowhere. Me trying to catch up, grab her arm. She stopped finally, gave me a face unmoved as I explained myself, one mental finger tamping down my exasperation: “Amy, I don’t get why I need to prove my love to you by remembering the exact same things you do, the exact same way you do. It doesn’t mean I don’t love our life together.”\n\nA nearby clown blew up a balloon animal, a man bought a rose, a child licked an ice cream cone, and a genuine tradition was born, one I’d never forget: Amy always going overboard, me never, ever worthy of the effort. Happy anniversary, asshole.\n\n“I’m guessing—five years—she’s going to get really pissed,” Go continued. “So I hope you got her a really good present.”\n\n“On the to-do list.”\n\n“What’s the, like, symbol, for five years? Paper?”\n\n“Paper is first year,” I said. At the end of Year One’s unexpectedly wrenching treasure hunt, Amy presented me with a set of posh stationery, my initials embossed at the top, the paper so creamy I expected my fingers to come away moist. In return, I’d presented my wife with a bright red dime-store paper kite, picturing the park, picnics, warm summer gusts. Neither of us liked our presents; we’d each have preferred the other’s. It was a reverse O. Henry.\n\n“Silver?” guessed Go. “Bronze? Scrimshaw? Help me out.”\n\n“Wood,” I said. “There’s no romantic present for wood.”\n\nAt the other end of the bar, Sue neatly folded her newspaper and left it on the bartop with her empty mug and a five-dollar bill. We all exchanged silent smiles as she walked out.\n\n“I got it,” Go said. “Go home, fuck her brains out, then smack her with your penis and scream, ‘There’s some wood for you, bitch!’ ”\n\nWe laughed. Then we both flushed pink in our cheeks in the same spot. It was the kind of raunchy, unsisterly joke that Go enjoyed tossing at me like a grenade. It was also the reason why, in high school, there were always rumors that we secretly screwed. Twincest. We were too tight: our inside jokes, our edge-of-the-party whispers. I’m pretty sure I don’t need to say this, but you are not Go, you might misconstrue, so I will: My sister and I have never screwed or even thought of screwing. We just really like each other.\n\nGo was now pantomiming dick-slapping my wife.\n\nNo, Amy and Go were never going to be friends. They were each too territorial. Go was used to being the alpha girl in my life, Amy was used to being the alpha girl in everyone’s life. For two people who lived in the same city—the same city twice: first New York, now here—they barely knew each other. They flitted in and out of my life like well-timed stage actors, one going out the door as the other came in, and on the rare occasions when they both inhabited the same room, they seemed somewhat bemused at the situation.\n\nBefore Amy and I got serious, got engaged, got married, I would get glimpses of Go’s thoughts in a sentence here or there. It’s funny, I can’t quite get a bead on her, like who she really is. And: You just seem kind of not yourself with her. And: There’s a difference between really loving someone and loving the idea of her. And finally: The important thing is she makes you really happy.\n\nBack when Amy made me really happy.\n\nAmy offered her own notions of Go: She’s very … Missouri, isn’t she? And: You just have to be in the right mood for her. And: She’s a little needy about you, but then I guess she doesn’t have anyone else.\n\nI’d hoped when we all wound up back in Missouri, the two would let it drop—agree to disagree, free to be you and me. Neither did. Go was funnier than Amy, though, so it was a mismatched battle. Amy was clever, withering, sarcastic. Amy could get me riled up, could make an excellent, barbed point, but Go always made me laugh. It is dangerous to laugh at your spouse.\n\n“Go, I thought we agreed you’d never mention my genitalia again,” I said. “That within the bounds of our sibling relationship, I have no genitalia.”\n\nThe phone rang. Go took one more sip of her beer and answered, gave an eyeroll and a smile. “He sure is here, one moment, please!” To me, she mouthed: “Carl.”\n\nCarl Pelley lived across the street from me and Amy. Retired three years. Divorced two years. Moved into our development right after. He’d been a traveling salesman—children’s party supplies—and I sensed that after four decades of motel living, he wasn’t quite at home being home. He showed up at the bar nearly every day with a pungent Hardee’s bag, complaining about his budget until he was offered a first drink on the house. (This was another thing I learned about Carl from his days in The Bar—that he was a functioning but serious alcoholic.) He had the good grace to accept whatever we were “trying to get rid of,” and he meant it: For one full month Carl drank nothing but dusty Zimas, circa 1992, that we’d discovered in the basement. When a hangover kept Carl home, he’d find a reason to call: Your mailbox looks awfully full today, Nicky, maybe a package came. Or: It’s supposed to rain, you might want to close your windows. The reasons were bogus. Carl just needed to hear the clink of glasses, the glug of a drink being poured.\n\nI picked up the phone, shaking a tumbler of ice near the receiver so Carl could imagine his gin.\n\n“Hey, Nicky,” Carl’s watery voice came over. “Sorry to bother you. I just thought you should know … your door is wide open, and that cat of yours is outside. It isn’t supposed to be, right?”\n\nI gave a noncommittal grunt.\n\n“I’d go over and check, but I’m a little under the weather,” Carl said heavily.\n\n“Don’t worry,” I said. “It’s time for me to go home anyway.”\n\nIt was a fifteen-minute drive, straight north along River Road. Driving into our development occasionally makes me shiver, the sheer number of gaping dark houses—homes that have never known inhabitants, or homes that have known owners and seen them ejected, the house standing triumphantly voided, humanless.\n\nWhen Amy and I moved in, our only neighbors descended on us: one middle-aged single mom of three, bearing a casserole; a young father of triplets with a six-pack of beer (his wife left at home with the triplets); an older Christian couple who lived a few houses down; and of course, Carl from across the street. We sat out on our back deck and watched the river, and they all talked ruefully about ARMs, and zero percent interest, and zero money down, and then they all remarked how Amy and I were the only ones with river access, the only ones without children. “Just the two of you? In this whole big house?” the single mom asked, doling out a scrambled-egg something.\n\n“Just the two of us,” I confirmed with a smile, and nodded in appreciation as I took a mouthful of wobbly egg.\n\n“Seems lonely.”\n\nOn that she was right.\n\nFour months later, the whole big house lady lost her mortgage battle and disappeared in the night with her three kids. Her house has remained empty. The living-room window still has a child’s picture of a butterfly taped to it, the bright Magic Marker sun-faded to brown. One evening not long ago, I drove past and saw a man, bearded, bedraggled, staring out from behind the picture, floating in the dark like some sad aquarium fish. He saw me see him and flickered back into the depths of the house. The next day I left a brown paper bag full of sandwiches on the front step; it sat in the sun untouched for a week, decaying wetly, until I picked it back up and threw it out.\n\nQuiet. The complex was always disturbingly quiet. As I neared our home, conscious of the noise of the car engine, I could see the cat was definitely on the steps. Still on the steps, twenty minutes after Carl’s call. This was strange. Amy loved the cat, the cat was declawed, the cat was never let outside, never ever, because the cat, Bleecker, was sweet but extremely stupid, and despite the LoJack tracking device pelleted somewhere in his fat furry rolls, Amy knew she’d never see the cat again if he ever got out. The cat would waddle straight into the Mississippi River—deedle-de-dum—and float all the way to the Gulf of Mexico into the maw of a hungry bull shark.\n\nBut it turned out the cat wasn’t even smart enough to get past the steps. Bleecker was perched on the edge of the porch, a pudgy but proud sentinel—Private Tryhard. As I pulled in to the drive, Carl came out and stood on his own front steps, and I could feel the cat and the old man both watching me as I got out of the car and walked toward the house, the red peonies along the border looking fat and juicy, asking to be devoured.\n\nI was about to go into blocking position to get the cat when I saw that the front door was open. Carl had said as much, but seeing it was different. This wasn’t taking-out-the-trash-back-in-a-minute open. This was wide-gaping-ominous open.\n\nCarl hovered across the way, waiting for my response, and like some awful piece of performance art, I felt myself enacting Concerned Husband. I stood on the middle step and frowned, then took the stairs quickly, two at a time, calling out my wife’s name.\n\nSilence.\n\n“Amy, you home?”\n\nI ran straight upstairs. No Amy. The ironing board was set up, the iron still on, a dress waiting to be pressed.\n\n“Amy!”\n\nAs I ran back downstairs, I could see Carl still framed in the open doorway, hands on hips, watching. I swerved into the living room, and pulled up short. The carpet glinted with shards of glass, the coffee table shattered. End tables were on their sides, books slid across the floor like a card trick. Even the heavy antique ottoman was belly-up, its four tiny feet in the air like something dead. In the middle of the mess was a pair of good sharp scissors.\n\n“Amy!”\n\nI began running, bellowing her name. Through the kitchen, where a teakettle was burning, down to the basement, where the guest room stood empty, and then out the back door. I pounded across our yard onto the slender boat deck leading out over the river. I peeked over the side to see if she was in our rowboat, where I had found her one day, tethered to the dock, rocking in the water, her face to the sun, eyes closed, and as I’d peered down into the dazzling reflections of the river, at her beautiful, still face, she’d suddenly opened her blue eyes and said nothing to me, and I’d said nothing back and gone into the house alone.\n\n“Amy!”\n\nShe wasn’t on the water, she wasn’t in the house. Amy was not there.", "characters": [{"name": "Nick", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Amy Elliott", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Amy"]}, {"name": "Margo", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Go"]}, {"name": "Carl Pelley", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Carl"]}, {"name": "Sue", "role": "MINOR"}, {"name": "Bleecker", "role": "MINOR"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0016}}
{"story_id": "it_ends_with_us_scene_a", "text": "As I sit here with one foot on either side of the ledge, looking down from twelve stories above the streets of Boston, I can’t help but think about suicide.\n\nNot my own. I like my life enough to want to see it through.\n\nI’m more focused on other people, and how they ultimately come to the decision to just end their own lives. Do they ever regret it? In the moment after letting go and the second before they make impact, there has to be a little bit of remorse in that brief free fall. Do they look at the ground as it rushes toward them and think, “Well, crap. This was a bad idea.”\n\nSomehow, I think not.\n\nI think about death a lot. Particularly today, considering I just—twelve hours earlier—gave one of the most epic eulogies the people of Plethora, Maine, have ever witnessed. Okay, maybe it wasn’t the most epic. It very well could be considered the most disastrous. I guess that would depend on whether you were asking my mother or me. My mother, who probably won’t speak to me for a solid year after today.\n\nDon’t get me wrong; the eulogy I delivered wasn’t profound enough to make history, like the one Brooke Shields delivered at Michael Jackson’s funeral. Or the one delivered by Steve Jobs’s sister. Or Pat Tillman’s brother. But it was epic in its own way.\n\nI was nervous at first. It was the funeral of the prodigious Andrew Bloom, after all. Adored mayor of my hometown of Plethora, Maine. Owner of the most successful real-estate agency within city limits. Husband of the highly adored Jenny Bloom, the most revered teaching assistant in all of Plethora. And father of Lily Bloom—that strange girl with the erratic red hair who once fell in love with a homeless guy and brought great shame upon her entire family.\n\nThat would be me. I’m Lily Bloom, and Andrew was my father.\n\nAs soon as I finished delivering his eulogy today, I caught a flight straight back to Boston and hijacked the first roof I could find. Again, not because I’m suicidal. I have no plans to scale off this roof. I just really needed fresh air and silence, and dammit if I can’t get that from my third floor apartment with absolutely no rooftop access and a roommate who likes to hear herself sing.\n\nI didn’t account for how cold it would be up here, though. It’s not unbearable, but it’s not comfortable, either. At least I can see the stars. Dead fathers and exasperating roommates and questionable eulogies don’t feel so awful when the night sky is clear enough to literally feel the grandeur of the universe.\n\nI love it when the sky makes me feel insignificant.\n\nI like tonight.\n\nWell . . . let me rephrase this so that it more appropriately reflects my feelings in past tense.\n\nI liked tonight.\n\nBut unfortunately for me, the door was just shoved open so hard, I expect the stairwell to spit a human out onto the rooftop. The door slams shut again and footsteps move swiftly across the deck. I don’t even bother looking up. Whoever it is more than likely won’t even notice me back here straddling the ledge to the left of the door. They came out here in such a hurry, it isn’t my fault if they assume they’re alone.\n\nI sigh quietly, close my eyes and lean my head against the stucco wall behind me, cursing the universe for ripping this peaceful, introspective moment out from under me. The least the universe could do for me today is ensure that it’s a woman and not a man. If I’m going to have company, I’d rather it be a female. I’m tough for my size and can probably hold my own in most cases, but I’m too comfortable right now to be on a rooftop alone with a strange man in the middle of the night. I might fear for my safety and feel the need to leave, and I really don’t want to leave. As I said before . . . I’m comfortable.\n\nI finally allow my eyes to make the journey to the silhouette leaning over the ledge. As luck would have it, he’s definitely male. Even leaning over the rail, I can tell he’s tall. Broad shoulders create a strong contrast to the fragile way he’s holding his head in his hands. I can barely make out the heavy rise and fall of his back as he drags in deep breaths and forces them back out when he’s done with them.\n\nHe appears to be on the verge of a breakdown. I contemplate speaking up to let him know he has company, or clearing my throat, but between thinking it and actually doing it, he spins around and kicks one of the patio chairs behind him.\n\nI flinch as it screeches across the deck, but being as though he isn’t even aware he has an audience, the guy doesn’t stop with just one kick. He kicks the chair repeatedly, over and over. Rather than give way beneath the blunt force of his foot, all the chair does is scoot farther and farther away from him.\n\nThat chair must be made from marine-grade polymer.\n\nI once watched my father back over an outdoor patio table made of marine-grade polymer, and it practically laughed at him. Dented his bumper, but didn’t even put a scratch on the table.\n\nThis guy must realize he’s no match for such a high-quality material, because he finally stops kicking the chair. He’s now standing over it, his hands clenched in fists at his sides. To be honest, I’m a little envious. Here this guy is, taking his aggression out on patio furniture like a champ. He’s obviously had a shitty day, as have I, but whereas I keep my aggression pent up until it manifests in the form of passive-aggressiveness, this guy actually has an outlet.\n\nMy outlet used to be gardening. Any time I was stressed, I’d just go out to the backyard and pull every single weed I could find. But since the day I moved to Boston two years ago, I haven’t had a backyard. Or a patio. I don’t even have weeds.\n\nMaybe I need to invest in a marine-grade polymer patio chair.\n\nI stare at the guy a moment longer, wondering if he’s ever going to move. He’s just standing there, staring down at the chair. His hands aren’t in fists anymore. They’re resting on his hips, and I notice for the first time how his shirt doesn’t fit him very well around his biceps. It fits him everywhere else, but his arms are huge. He begins fishing around in his pockets until he finds what he’s looking for and—in what I’m sure is probably an effort to release even more of his aggression—he lights up a joint.\n\nI’m twenty-three, I’ve been through college and have done this very same recreational drug a time or two. I’m not going to judge this guy for feeling the need to toke up in private. But that’s the thing—he’s not in private. He just doesn’t know that yet.\n\nHe takes in a long drag of his joint and starts to turn back toward the ledge. He notices me on the exhale. He stops walking the second our eyes meet. His expression holds no shock, nor does it hold amusement when he sees me. He’s about ten feet away, but there’s enough light from the stars that I can see his eyes as they slowly drag over my body without revealing a single thought. This guy holds his cards well. His gaze is narrow and his mouth is drawn tight, like a male version of the Mona Lisa.\n\n“What’s your name?” he asks.\n\nI feel his voice in my stomach. That’s not good. Voices should stop at the ears, but sometimes—not very often at all, actually—a voice will penetrate past my ears and reverberate straight down through my body. He has one of those voices. Deep, confident, and a little bit like butter.\n\nWhen I don’t answer him, he brings the joint back to his mouth and takes another hit.\n\n“Lily,” I finally say. I hate my voice. It sounds too weak to even reach his ears from here, much less reverberate inside his body.\n\nHe lifts his chin a little and nudges his head toward me. “Will you please get down from there, Lily?”\n\nIt isn’t until he says this that I notice his posture. He’s standing straight up now, rigid even. Almost as if he’s nervous I’m going to fall. I’m not. This ledge is at least a foot wide, and I’m mostly on the roof side. I could easily catch myself before I fell, not to mention I’ve got the wind in my favor.\n\nI glance down at my legs and then back up at him. “No, thanks. I’m quite comfortable where I am.”\n\nHe turns a little, like he can’t look straight at me. “Please get down.” It’s more of a demand now, despite his use of the word please. “There are seven empty chairs up here.”\n\n“Almost six,” I correct, reminding him that he just tried to murder one of them. He doesn’t find the humor in my response. When I fail to follow his orders, he takes a couple of steps closer.\n\n“You are a mere three inches from falling to your death. I’ve been around enough of that for one day.” He motions for me to get down again. “You’re making me nervous. Not to mention ruining my high.”\n\nI roll my eyes and swing my legs over. “Heaven forbid a joint go to waste.” I hop down and wipe my hands across my jeans. “Better?” I say as I walk toward him.\n\nHe lets out a rush of air, as if seeing me on the ledge actually had him holding his breath. I pass him to head for the side of the roof with the better view, and as I do, I can’t help but notice how unfortunately cute he is.\n\nNo. Cute is an insult.\n\nThis guy is beautiful. Well-manicured, smells like money, looks to be several years older than me. His eyes crinkle in the corners as they follow me, and his lips seem to frown, even when they aren’t. When I reach the side of the building that overlooks the street, I lean forward and stare down at the cars below, trying not to appear impressed by him. I can tell by his haircut alone that he’s the kind of man people are easily impressed by, and I refuse to feed into his ego. Not that he’s done anything to make me think he even has one. But he is wearing a casual Burberry shirt, and I’m not sure I’ve ever been on the radar of someone who could casually afford one.\n\nI hear footsteps approaching from behind, and then he leans against the railing next to me. Out of the corner of my eye, I watch as he takes another hit of his joint. When he’s finished, he offers it to me, but I wave it off. The last thing I need is to be under the influence around this guy. His voice is a drug in itself. I kind of want to hear it again, so I throw a question in his direction.\n\n“So what did that chair do to make you so angry?”\n\nHe looks at me. Like really looks at me. His eyes meet mine and he just stares, hard, like all my secrets are right there on my face. I’ve never seen eyes as dark as his. Maybe I have, but they seem darker when they’re attached to such an intimidating presence. He doesn’t answer my question, but my curiosity isn’t easily put to rest. If he’s going to force me down from a very peaceful, comfortable ledge, then I expect him to entertain me with answers to my nosy questions.\n\n“Was it a woman?” I inquire. “Did she break your heart?”\n\nHe laughs a little with that question. “If only my issues were as trivial as matters of the heart.” He leans into the wall so that he can face me. “What floor do you live on?” He licks his fingers and pinches the end of his joint, then puts it back in his pocket. “I’ve never noticed you before.”\n\n“That’s because I don’t live here.” I point in the direction of my apartment. “See that insurance building?”\n\nHe squints as he looks in the direction I’m pointing. “Yeah.”\n\n“I live in the building next to it. It’s too short to see from here. It’s only three stories tall.”\n\nHe’s facing me again, resting his elbow on the ledge. “If you live over there, why are you here? Your boyfriend live here or something?”\n\nHis comment somehow makes me feel cheap. It was too easy—an amateurish pickup line. From the looks of this guy, I know he has better skills than that. It makes me think he saves the more difficult pickup lines for the women he deems worthy.\n\n“You have a nice roof,” I tell him.\n\nHe lifts an eyebrow, waiting for more of an explanation.\n\n“I wanted fresh air. Somewhere to think. I pulled up Google Earth and found the closest apartment complex with a decent rooftop patio.”\n\nHe regards me with a smile. “At least you’re economical,” he says. “That’s a good quality to have.”\n\nAt least?\n\nI nod, because I am economical. And it is a good quality to have.\n\n“Why did you need fresh air?” he asks.\n\nBecause I buried my father today and gave an epically disastrous eulogy and now I feel like I can’t breathe.\n\nI face forward again and slowly exhale. “Can we just not talk for a little while?”\n\nHe seems a bit relieved that I asked for silence. He leans over the ledge and lets an arm dangle as he stares down at the street. He stays like this for a while, and I stare at him the entire time. He probably knows I’m staring, but he doesn’t seem to care.\n\n“A guy fell off this roof last month,” he says.\n\nI would be annoyed at his lack of respect for my request for silence, but I’m kind of intrigued.\n\n“Was it an accident?”\n\nHe shrugs. “No one knows. It happened late in the evening. His wife said she was cooking dinner and he told her he was coming up here to take some pictures of the sunset. He was a photographer. They think he was leaning over the ledge to get a shot of the skyline, and he slipped.”\n\nI look over the ledge, wondering how someone could possibly put themselves in a situation where they could fall by accident. But then I remember I was just straddling the ledge on the other side of the roof a few minutes ago.\n\n“When my sister told me what happened, the only thing I could think about was whether or not he got the shot. I was hoping his camera didn’t fall with him, because that would have been a real waste, you know? To die because of your love of photography, but you didn’t even get the final shot that cost you your life?”\n\nHis thought makes me laugh. Although I’m not sure I should have laughed at that. “Do you always say exactly what’s on your mind?”\n\nHe shrugs. “Not to most people.”\n\nThis makes me smile. I like that he doesn’t even know me, but for whatever reason, I’m not considered most people to him.\n\nHe rests his back against the ledge and folds his arms over his chest. “Were you born here?”\n\nI shake my head. “No. Moved here from Maine after I graduated college.”\n\nHe scrunches up his nose, and it’s kind of hot. Watching this guy—dressed in his Burberry shirt with his two-hundred-dollar haircut—making silly faces.\n\n“So you’re in Boston purgatory, huh? That’s gotta suck.”\n\n“What do you mean?” I ask him.\n\nThe corner of his mouth curls up. “The tourists treat you like a local; the locals treat you like a tourist.”\n\nI laugh. “Wow. That’s a very accurate description.”\n\n“I’ve been here two months. I’m not even in purgatory yet, so you’re doing better than I am.”\n\n“What brought you to Boston?”\n\n“My residency. And my sister lives here.” He taps his foot and says, “Right beneath us, actually. Married a tech-savvy Bostonian and they bought the entire top floor.”\n\nI look down. “The entire top floor?”\n\nHe nods. “Lucky bastard works from home. Doesn’t even have to change out of his pajamas and makes seven figures a year.”", "characters": [{"name": "Lily Bloom", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Andrew Bloom", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Jenny Bloom", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0011}}
{"story_id": "it_ends_with_us_scene_b", "text": "Lucky bastard, indeed.\n\n“What kind of residency? Are you a doctor?”\n\nHe nods. “Neurosurgeon. Less than a year left of my residency and then it’s official.”\n\nStylish, well spoken, and smart. And smokes pot. If this were an SAT question, I would ask which one didn’t belong. “Should doctors be smoking weed?”\n\nHe smirks. “Probably not. But if we didn’t indulge on occasion, there would be a lot more of us taking the leap over these ledges, I can promise you that.” He’s facing forward again with his chin resting on his arms. His eyes are closed now, like he’s enjoying the wind against his face. He doesn’t look as intimidating like this.\n\n“You want to know something that only the locals know?”\n\n“Of course,” he says, bringing his attention back to me.\n\nI point to the east. “See that building? The one with the green roof?”\n\nHe nods.\n\n“There’s a building behind it on Melcher. There’s a house on top of the building. Like a legit house, built right on the rooftop. You can’t see it from the street, and the building is so tall that not many people even know about it.”\n\nHe looks impressed. “Really?”\n\nI nod. “I saw it when I was searching Google Earth, so I looked it up. Apparently a permit was granted for the construction in 1982. How cool would that be? To live in a house on top of a building?”\n\n“You’d get the whole roof to yourself,” he says.\n\nI hadn’t thought of that. If I owned it I could plant gardens up there. I’d have an outlet.\n\n“Who lives there?” he asks.\n\n“No one really knows. It’s one of the great mysteries of Boston.”\n\nHe laughs and then looks at me inquisitively. “What’s another great mystery of Boston?”\n\n“Your name.” As soon as I say it, I slap my hand against my forehead. It sounded so much like a cheesy pickup line; the only thing I can do is laugh at myself.\n\nHe smiles. “It’s Ryle,” he says. “Ryle Kincaid.”\n\nI sigh, sinking into myself. “That’s a really great name.”\n\n“Why do you sound sad about it?”\n\n“Because, I’d give anything for a great name.”\n\n“You don’t like the name Lily?”\n\nI tilt my head and cock an eyebrow. “My last name . . . is Bloom.”\n\nHe’s quiet. I can feel him trying to hold back his pity.\n\n“I know. It’s awful. It’s the name of a two-year-old little girl, not a twenty-three-year-old woman.”\n\n“A two-year-old girl will have the same name no matter how old she gets. Names aren’t something we eventually grow out of, Lily Bloom.”\n\n“Unfortunately for me,” I say. “But what makes it even worse is that I absolutely love gardening. I love flowers. Plants. Growing things. It’s my passion. It’s always been my dream to open a florist shop, but I’m afraid if I did, people wouldn’t think my desire was authentic. They would think I was trying to capitalize off my name and that being a florist isn’t really my dream job.”\n\n“Maybe so,” he says. “But what’s that matter?”\n\n“It doesn’t, I suppose.” I catch myself whispering, “Lily Bloom’s” quietly. I can see him smiling a little bit. “It really is a great name for a florist. But I have a master’s degree in business. I’d be downgrading, don’t you think? I work for the biggest marketing firm in Boston.”\n\n“Owning your own business isn’t downgrading,” he says.\n\nI raise an eyebrow. “Unless it flops.”\n\nHe nods in agreement. “Unless it flops,” he says. “So what’s your middle name, Lily Bloom?”\n\nI groan, which makes him perk up.\n\n“You mean it gets worse?”\n\nI drop my head in my hands and nod.\n\n“Rose?”\n\nI shake my head. “Worse.”\n\n“Violet?”\n\n“I wish.” I cringe and then mutter, “Blossom.”\n\nThere’s a moment of silence. “Goddamn,” he says softly.\n\n“Yeah. Blossom is my mother’s maiden name and my parents thought it was fate that their last names were synonyms. So of course when they had me, a flower was their first choice.”\n\n“Your parents must be real assholes.”\n\nOne of them is. Was. “My father died this week.”\n\nHe glances at me. “Nice try. I’m not falling for that.”\n\n“I’m serious. That’s why I came up here tonight. I think I just needed a good cry.”\n\nHe stares at me suspiciously for a moment to make sure I’m not pulling his leg. He doesn’t apologize for the blunder. Instead, his eyes grow a little more curious, like his intrigue is actually authentic. “Were you close?”\n\nThat’s a hard question. I rest my chin on my arms and look down at the street again. “I don’t know,” I say with a shrug. “As his daughter, I loved him. But as a human, I hated him.”\n\nI can feel him watching me for a moment, and then he says, “I like that. Your honesty.”\n\nHe likes my honesty. I think I might be blushing.\n\nWe’re both quiet again for a while, and then he says, “Do you ever wish people were more transparent?”\n\n“How so?”\n\nHe picks at a piece of chipped stucco with his thumb until it breaks loose. He flicks it over the ledge. “I feel like everyone fakes who they really are, when deep down we’re all equal amounts of screwed up. Some of us are just better at hiding it than others.”\n\nEither his high is setting in, or he’s just very introspective. Either way, I’m okay with it. My favorite conversations are the ones with no real answers.\n\n“I don’t think being a little guarded is a negative thing,” I say. “Naked truths aren’t always pretty.”\n\nHe stares at me for a moment. “Naked truths,” he repeats. “I like that.” He turns around and walks to the middle of the rooftop. He adjusts the back on one of the patio loungers behind me and lowers himself onto it. It’s the kind you lie on, so he pulls his hands behind his head and looks up at the sky. I claim the one next to him and adjust it until I’m in the same position as him.\n\n“Tell me a naked truth, Lily.”\n\n“Pertaining to what?”\n\nHe shrugs. “I don’t know. Something you aren’t proud of. Something that will make me feel a little less screwed up on the inside.”\n\nHe’s staring up at the sky, waiting on me to answer. My eyes follow the line of his jaw, the curve of his cheeks, the outline of his lips. His eyebrows are drawn together in contemplation. I don’t understand why, but he seems to need conversation right now. I think about his question and try to find an honest answer. When I come up with one, I look away from him and back up to the sky.\n\n“My father was abusive. Not to me—to my mother. He would get so angry when they fought that sometimes he would hit her. When that happened, he would spend the next week or two making up for it. He would do things like buy her flowers or take us out to a nice dinner. Sometimes he would buy me stuff because he knew I hated it when they fought. When I was a kid, I found myself looking forward to the nights they would fight. Because I knew if he hit her, the two weeks that followed would be great.” I pause. I’m not sure I’ve ever admitted that to myself. “Of course if I could, I would have made it to where he never touched her. But the abuse was inevitable with their marriage, and it became our norm. When I got older, I realized that not doing something about it made me just as guilty. I spent most of my life hating him for being such a bad person, but I’m not so sure I’m much better. Maybe we’re both bad people.”\n\nRyle looks over at me with a thoughtful expression. “Lily,” he says pointedly. “There is no such thing as bad people. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things.”\n\nI open my mouth to respond, but his words strike me silent. We’re all just people who sometimes do bad things. I guess that’s true in a way. No one is exclusively bad, nor is anyone exclusively good. Some are just forced to work harder at suppressing the bad.\n\n“Your turn,” I tell him.\n\nBased on his reaction, I think he might not want to play his own game. He sighs heavily and runs a hand through his hair. He opens his mouth to speak, but then clamps it shut again. He thinks for a bit, and then finally speaks. “I watched a little boy die tonight.” His voice is despondent. “He was only five years old. He and his little brother found a gun in his parents’ bedroom. The younger brother was holding it and it went off by accident.”\n\nMy stomach flips. I think this may be a little too much truth for me.\n\n“There was nothing that could be done by the time he made it to the operating table. Everyone around—nurses, other doctors—they all felt so sorry for the family. ‘Those poor parents,’ they said. But when I had to walk into the waiting room and tell those parents that their child didn’t make it, I didn’t feel an ounce of sorrow for them. I wanted them to suffer. I wanted them to feel the weight of their ignorance for keeping a loaded gun within access of two innocent children. I wanted them to know that not only did they just lose a child, they just ruined the entire life of the one who accidentally pulled the trigger.”\n\nJesus Christ. I wasn’t prepared for something so heavy.\n\nI can’t even conceive how a family moves past that. “That poor boy’s brother,” I say. “I can’t imagine what that’s going to do to him—seeing something like that.”\n\nRyle flicks something off the knee of his jeans. “It’ll destroy him for life, that’s what it’ll do.”\n\nI turn on my side to face him, lifting my head up onto my hand. “Is it hard? Seeing things like that every day?”\n\nHe gives his head a slight shake. “It should be a lot harder, but the more I’m around death, the more it just becomes a part of life. I’m not sure how I feel about that.” He makes eye contact with me again. “Give me another one,” he says. “I feel like mine was a little more twisted than yours.”\n\nI disagree, but I tell him about the twisted thing I did a mere twelve hours ago.\n\n“My mother asked me two days ago if I would deliver the eulogy at my father’s funeral today. I told her I didn’t feel comfortable—that I might be crying too hard to speak in front of a crowd—but that was a lie. I just didn’t want to do it because I feel like eulogies should be delivered by those who respected the deceased. And I didn’t much respect my father.”\n\n“Did you do it?”\n\nI nod. “Yeah. This morning.” I sit up and pull my legs beneath me as I face him. “You want to hear it?”\n\nHe smiles. “Absolutely.”\n\nI fold my hands in my lap and inhale a breath. “I had no idea what to say. About an hour before the funeral, I told my mother I didn’t want to do it. She said it was simple and that my father would have wanted me to do it. She said all I had to do was walk up to the podium and say five great things about my father. So . . . that’s exactly what I did.”\n\nRyle lifts up onto his elbow, appearing even more interested. He can tell by the look on my face that it gets worse. “Oh, no, Lily. What did you do?”\n\n“Here. Let me just reenact it for you.” I stand up and walk around to the other side of my chair. I stand tall and act like I’m looking out over the same crowded room I was met with this morning. I clear my throat.", "characters": [{"name": "Lily Bloom", "role": "PROTAGONIST", "aliases": ["Lily"]}, {"name": "Ryle Kincaid", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Ryle"]}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.001}}
{"story_id": "little_fires_scene_a", "text": "Everyone in Shaker Heights was talking about it that summer: how Isabelle, the last of the Richardson children, had finally gone around the bend and burned the house down. All spring the gossip had been about little Mirabelle McCullough—or, depending which side you were on, May Ling Chow—and now, at last, there was something new and sensational to discuss. A little after noon on that Saturday in May, the shoppers pushing their grocery carts in Heinen’s heard the fire engines wail to life and careen away, toward the duck pond. By a quarter after twelve there were four of them parked in a haphazard red line along Parkland Drive, where all six bedrooms of the Richardson house were ablaze, and everyone within a half mile could see the smoke rising over the trees like a dense black thundercloud. Later people would say that the signs had been there all along: that Izzy was a little lunatic, that there had always been something off about the Richardson family, that as soon as they heard the sirens that morning they knew something terrible had happened. By then, of course, Izzy would be long gone, leaving no one to defend her, and people could—and did—say whatever they liked. At the moment the fire trucks arrived, though, and for quite a while afterward, no one knew what was happening. Neighbors clustered as close to the makeshift barrier—a police cruiser, parked crosswise a few hundred yards away—as they could and watched the firefighters unreel their hoses with the grim faces of men who recognized a hopeless cause. Across the street, the geese at the pond ducked their heads underwater for weeds, wholly unruffled by the commotion.\n\n\t\t\tMrs. Richardson stood on the tree lawn, clutching the neck of her pale blue robe closed. Although it was already afternoon, she had still been asleep when the smoke detectors had sounded. She had gone to bed late, and had slept in on purpose, telling herself she deserved it after a rather difficult day. The night before, she had watched from an upstairs window as a car had finally pulled up in front of the house. The driveway was long and circular, a deep horseshoe arc bending from the curb to the front door and back—so the street was a good hundred feet away, too far for her to see clearly, and even in May, at eight o’clock it was almost dark, besides. But she had recognized the small tan Volkswagen of her tenant, Mia, its headlights shining. The passenger door opened and a slender figure emerged, leaving the door ajar: Mia’s teenage daughter, Pearl. The dome light lit the inside of the car like a shadow box, but the car was packed with bags nearly to the ceiling and Mrs. Richardson could only just make out the faint silhouette of Mia’s head, the messy topknot perched at the crown of her head. Pearl bent over the mailbox, and Mrs. Richardson imagined the faint squeak as the mailbox door opened, then shut. Then Pearl hopped back into the car and closed the door. The brake lights flared red, then winked out, and the car puttered off into the growing night. With a sense of relief, Mrs. Richardson had gone down to the mailbox and found a set of keys on a plain ring, with no note. She had planned to go over in the morning and check the rental house on Winslow Road, even though she already knew that they would be gone.\n\n\t\t\tIt was because of this that she had allowed herself to sleep in, and now it was half past twelve and she was standing on the tree lawn in her robe and a pair of her son Trip’s tennis shoes, watching their house burn to the ground. When she had awoken to the shrill scream of the smoke detector, she ran from room to room looking for him, for Lexie, for Moody. It struck her that she had not looked for Izzy, as if she had known already that Izzy was to blame. Every bedroom was empty except for the smell of gasoline and a small crackling fire set directly in the middle of each bed, as if a demented Girl Scout had been camping there. By the time she checked the living room, the family room, the rec room, and the kitchen, the smoke had begun to spread, and she ran outside at last to hear the sirens, alerted by their home security system, already approaching. Out in the driveway, she saw that Trip’s Jeep was gone, as was Lexie’s Explorer, and Moody’s bike, and, of course, her husband’s sedan. He usually went into the office to play catch-up on Saturday mornings. Someone would have to call him at work. She remembered then that Lexie, thank god, had stayed over at Serena Wong’s house last night. She wondered where Izzy had gotten to. She wondered where her sons were, and how she would find them to tell them what had happened.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\tBy the time the fire was put out the house had not, despite Mrs. Richardson’s fears, quite burned to the ground. The windows were all gone but the brick shell of the house remained, damp and blackened and steaming, and most of the roof, the dark slate shingles gleaming like fish scales from their recent soaking. The Richardsons would not be allowed inside for another few days, until the fire department’s engineers had tested each of the beams still standing, but even from the tree lawn—the closest the yellow CAUTION tape would allow them to come—they could see there was little inside to be saved.\n\n\t\t\t“Jesus Christ,” Lexie said. She was perched on the roof of her car, which was now parked across the street, on the grass bordering the duck pond. She and Serena had still been asleep, curled up back-to-back in Serena’s queen size, when Dr. Wong shook her shoulder just after one, whispering, “Lexie. Lexie, honey. Wake up. Your mom just called.” They had stayed up past two A.M., talking—as they had been all spring—about little Mirabelle McCullough, arguing about whether the judge had decided right or wrong, about whether her new parents should’ve gotten custody or if she should’ve been given back to her own mother. “Her name isn’t even really Mirabelle McCullough, for god’s sake,” Serena had said at last, and they’d lapsed into sullen, troubled silence until they both fell asleep.\n\n\t\t\tNow Lexie watched the smoke billow from her bedroom window, the front one that looked over the lawn, and thought of everything inside that was gone. Every T-shirt in her dresser, every pair of jeans in her closet. All the notes Serena had written her since the sixth grade, still folded in paper footballs, which she’d kept in a shoebox under her bed; the bed itself, the very sheets and comforter charred to a crisp. The rose corsage her boyfriend, Brian, had given her at homecoming, hung to dry on her vanity, the petals darkened from ruby to dried-blood red. Now it was nothing but ashes. In the change of clothes she had brought to Serena’s, Lexie realized suddenly, she was better off than the rest of her family: in the backseat she had a duffel bag, a pair of jeans, a toothbrush. Pajamas. She glanced at her brothers, at her mother, still in her bathrobe on their tree lawn, and thought, They have literally nothing but the clothes on their backs. Literally was one of Lexie’s favorite words, which she deployed even when the situation was anything but literal. In this case, for once, it was more or less true.\n\n\t\t\tTrip, from his spot beside her, absentmindedly ran one hand through his hair. The sun was high overhead now and the sweat made his curls stand up rather rakishly. He had been playing basketball at the community center when he heard fire trucks wailing, but had thought nothing of it. (This morning he had been particularly preoccupied, but in truth he likely would not have noticed anyway.) Then, at one, when everyone got hungry and decided to call it a game, he had driven home. True to form, even with the windows down he had not noticed the huge cloud of smoke wafting toward him, and he only began to realize something was wrong when he found his street blocked off by a police car. After ten minutes of explaining, he had finally been allowed to park his Jeep across from the house, where Lexie and Moody were already waiting. The three of them sat on the car’s roof in order, as they had in all the family portraits that had once hung in the stairwell and were now reduced to ash. Lexie, Trip, Moody: senior, junior, sophomore. Beside them they felt the hole that Izzy, the freshman, the black sheep, the wild card, had left behind—though they were still certain, all of them, that this hole would be temporary.\n\n\t\t\t“What was she thinking?” Moody muttered, and Lexie said, “Even she knows she’s gone too far this time, that’s why she ran off. When she comes back, Mom is going to murder her.”\n\n\t\t\t“Where are we going to stay?” Trip asked. A moment of silence unreeled as they contemplated their situation.\n\n\t\t\t“We’ll get a hotel room or something,” said Lexie finally. “I think that’s what Josh Trammell’s family did.” Everyone knew this story: how a few years ago Josh Trammell, a sophomore, had fallen asleep with a candle lit and burned his parents’ house down. The long-standing rumor at the high school was that it wasn’t a candle, it was a joint, but the house had been so thoroughly gutted there was no way to tell, and Josh had stuck to his candle story. Everyone still thought of him as that dumbass jock who burned the house down, even though that had been ages ago, and Josh had recently graduated from Ohio State with honors. Now, of course, Josh Trammell’s fire would no longer be the most famous fire in Shaker Heights.\n\n\t\t\t“One hotel room? For all of us?”\n\n\t\t\t“Whatever. Two rooms. Or we’ll stay at the Embassy Suites. I don’t know.” Lexie tapped her fingers against her knee. She wanted a cigarette, but after what had just happened—and in full view of her mother and ten firemen—she didn’t dare light one. “Mom and Dad will figure it out. And the insurance will pay for it.” Although she had only a vague sense of how insurance worked, this seemed plausible. In any case, this was a problem for the adults, not for them.\n\n\t\t\tThe last of the firemen were emerging from the house, pulling the masks from their faces. Most of the smoke had gone, but a mugginess still hung everywhere, like the air in the bathroom after a long, hot shower. The roof of the car was getting hot, and Trip stretched his legs down the windshield, poking the wipers with the toe of his flip-flop. Then he started to laugh.\n\n\t\t\t“What’s so funny?” Lexie said.\n\n\t\t\t“Just picturing Izzy running around striking matches everywhere.” He snorted. “The nutcase.”\n\n\t\t\tMoody drummed a finger on the roof rack. “Why is everybody so sure she did it?”\n\n\t\t\t“Come on.” Trip jumped down off the car. “It’s Izzy. And we’re all here. Mom’s here. Dad’s on his way. Who’s missing?”\n\n\t\t\t“So Izzy’s not here. She’s the only one who could be responsible?”\n\n\t\t\t“Responsible?” put in Lexie. “Izzy?”\n\n\t\t\t“Dad was at work,” Trip said. “Lexie was at Serena’s. I was over at Sussex playing ball. You?”\n\n\t\t\tMoody hesitated. “I biked over to the library.”\n\n\t\t\t“There. You see?” To Trip, the answer was obvious. “The only ones here were Izzy and Mom. And Mom was asleep.”\n\n\t\t\t“Maybe the wiring in the house shorted. Or maybe someone left the stove on.”\n\n\t\t\t“The firemen said there were little fires everywhere,” Lexie said. “Multiple points of origin. Possible use of accelerant. Not an accident.”\n\n\t\t\t“We all know she’s always been mental.” Trip leaned back against the car door.\n\n\t\t\t“You’re all always picking on her,” Moody said. “Maybe that’s why she acts mental.”\n\n\t\t\tAcross the street, the fire trucks began to reel in their hoses. The three remaining Richardson children watched the firemen set down their axes and peel away their smoky yellow coats.\n\n\t\t\t“Someone should go over and stay with Mom,” Lexie said, but no one moved.\n\n\t\t\tAfter a minute, Trip said, “When Mom and Dad find Iz, they are going to lock her up in a psych ward for the rest of her life.”\n\n\t\t\tNo one thought about the recent departure of Mia and Pearl from the house on Winslow Road. Mrs. Richardson, watching the fire chief meticulously taking notes on his clipboard, had completely forgotten about her former tenants. She had not yet mentioned it to her husband or her children; Moody had discovered their absence only earlier that morning, and was still unsure what to make of it. Far down Parkland Drive the small blue dot of their father’s BMW began to approach.\n\n\t\t\t“What makes you so sure they’ll find her?” Moody asked.", "characters": [{"name": "Isabelle Richardson", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Izzy"]}, {"name": "Elena Richardson", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Mrs. Richardson", "Mom"]}, {"name": "Lexie Richardson", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Lexie"]}, {"name": "Trip Richardson", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Trip"]}, {"name": "Moody Richardson", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Moody"]}, {"name": "Mia Warren", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Mia"]}, {"name": "Pearl Warren", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Pearl"]}, {"name": "Serena Wong", "role": "MINOR", "aliases": ["Serena"]}, {"name": "Dr. Wong", "role": "MINOR"}, {"name": "Mirabelle McCullough", "role": "MINOR", "aliases": ["May Ling Chow"]}, {"name": "Josh Trammell", "role": "MINOR", "aliases": ["Josh"]}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.005}}
{"story_id": "little_fires_scene_b", "text": "The previous June, when Mia and Pearl had moved into the little rental house on Winslow Road, neither Mrs. Richardson (who technically owned the house) nor Mr. Richardson (who handed over the keys) had given them much thought. They knew there was no Mr. Warren, and that Mia was thirty-six, according to the Michigan driver’s license she had provided. They noticed that she wore no ring on her left hand, though she wore plenty of other rings: a big amethyst on her first finger, one made from a silver spoon handle on her pinkie, and one on her thumb that to Mrs. Richardson looked suspiciously like a mood ring. But she seemed nice enough, and so did her daughter, Pearl, a quiet fifteen-year-old with a long dark braid. Mia paid the first and last months’ rent, and the deposit, in a stack of twenty-dollar bills, and the tan VW Rabbit—already battered, even then—puttered away down Parkland Drive, toward the south end of Shaker, where the houses were closer together and the yards smaller.\n\n\t\t\tWinslow Road was one long line of duplexes, but standing on the curb you would not have known it. From the outside you saw only one front door, one front-door light, one mailbox, one house number. You might, perhaps, spot the two electrical meters, but those—per city ordinance—were concealed at the back of the house, along with the garage. Only if you came into the entryway would you see the two inner doors, one leading to the upstairs apartment, one to the downstairs, and their shared basement beneath. Every house on Winslow Road held two families, but outside appeared to hold only one. They had been designed that way on purpose. It allowed residents to avoid the stigma of living in a duplex house—of renting, instead of owning—and allowed the city planners to preserve the appearance of the street, as everyone knew neighborhoods with rentals were less desirable.\n\n\t\t\tShaker Heights was like that. There were rules, many rules, about what you could and could not do, as Mia and Pearl began to learn as they settled into their new home. They learned to write their new address: 18434 Winslow Road Up, those two little letters ensuring that their mail ended up in their apartment, and not with Mr. Yang downstairs. They learned that the little strip of grass between sidewalk and street was called a tree lawn—because of the young Norway maple, one per house, that graced it—and that garbage cans were not dragged there on Friday mornings but instead left at the rear of the house, to avoid the unsightly spectacle of trash cans cluttering the curb. Large motor scooters, each piloted by a man in an orange work suit, zipped down each driveway to collect the garbage in the privacy of the backyard, ferrying it to the larger truck idling out in the street, and for months Mia would remember their first Friday on Winslow Road, the fright she’d had when the scooter, like a revved-up flame-colored golf cart, shot past the kitchen window with engine roaring. They got used to it eventually, just as they got used to the detached garage—stationed well at the back of the house, again to preserve the view of the street—and learned to carry an umbrella to keep them dry as they ran from car to house on rainy days. Later, when Mr. Yang went away for two weeks in July, to visit his mother in Hong Kong, they learned that an unmowed lawn would result in a polite but stern letter from the city, noting that their grass was over six inches tall and that if the situation was not rectified, the city would mow the grass—and charge them a hundred dollars—in three days. There were many rules to be learned.\n\n\t\t\tAnd there were many other rules that Mia and Pearl would not be aware of for a long time. The rules governing what colors a house could be painted, for example. A helpful chart from the city categorized every home as a Tudor, English, or French style and laid out the appropriate colors for architects and homeowners alike. “English-style” houses could be painted only slate blue, moss green, or a certain shade of tan, to ensure aesthetic harmony on each street; Tudor houses required a specific shade of cream on the plaster and a specific dark brown on the timbers. In Shaker Heights there was a plan for everything. When the city had been laid out in 1912—one of the first planned communities in the nation—schools had been situated so that all children could walk without crossing a major street; side streets fed into major boulevards, with strategically placed rapid-transit stops to ferry commuters into downtown Cleveland. In fact, the city’s motto was—literally, as Lexie would have said—“Most communities just happen; the best are planned”: the underlying philosophy being that everything could—and should—be planned out, and that by doing so you could avoid the unseemly, the unpleasant, and the disastrous.\n\n\t\t\tBut there were other, more welcoming things to discover in those first few weeks as well. Between cleaning and repainting and unpacking, they learned the names of the streets around them: Winchell, Latimore, Lynnfield. They learned their way around the local grocery store, Heinen’s, which Mia said treated you like aristocracy. Instead of wheeling your cart out to the parking lot, a cart boy in a pressed poplin shirt hung a number on it and handed you a matching red-and-white tag. Then you hooked the tag on the window of your car and drove up to the front of the store, where another cart boy would wheel your groceries out to you and pack them tidily into your trunk and refuse to accept a tip.\n\n\t\t\tThey learned where the cheapest gas station was—at the corner of Lomond and Lee Roads, always one cent less than anywhere else; where the drugstores were and which gave double coupons. They learned that in nearby Cleveland Heights and Warrensville and Beachwood, residents placed their discarded belongings at the curb like ordinary people, and they learned which days were garbage days on which streets. They learned where to buy a hammer, a screwdriver, a quart of new paint and a brush: all could be found at Shaker Hardware, but only between the hours of nine thirty and six P.M., when the owner sent his employees home for dinner.\n\n\t\t\tAnd, for Pearl, there was the discovery of their landlords, and of the Richardson children.\n\n\t\t\tMoody was the first of the Richardsons to venture to the little house on Winslow. He had heard his mother describing their new tenants to his father. “She’s some kind of artist,” Mrs. Richardson had said, and when Mr. Richardson asked what kind, she answered jokingly, “A struggling one.”\n\n\t\t\t“It’s all right,” she reassured her husband. “She gave me a deposit right up front.” “That doesn’t mean she’ll pay the rent,” Mr. Richardson said, but they both knew it wasn’t the rent that was important—only three hundred dollars a month for the upstairs—and they certainly didn’t need it to get by. Mr. Richardson was a defense attorney and Mrs. Richardson worked for the local paper, the Sun Press. The Winslow house was theirs free and clear; Mrs. Richardson’s parents had bought it as an investment property when she was a teenager. Its rent had helped put her through Denison, then had become a monthly “booster”—as her mother had put it—while she started off as a cub reporter. Then, after she’d married Bill Richardson and become Mrs. Richardson, it had helped make up the down payment on a beautiful Shaker house of their own, the same house on Parkland that she would later watch burn. When Mrs. Richardson’s parents had died, five years ago and within months of each other, she had inherited the Winslow house. Her parents had been in an assisted-living home for some time by then, and the house she had grown up in had already been sold. But they had kept the Winslow house, its rent paying for their care, and now Mrs. Richardson kept it, too, as a sentimental memory.\n\n\t\t\tNo, it wasn’t the money that mattered. The rent—all five hundred dollars of it in total—now went into the Richardsons’ vacation fund each month, and last year it had paid for their trip to Martha’s Vineyard, where Lexie had perfected her backstroke and Trip had bewitched all the local girls and Moody had sunburnt to a peeling crisp and Izzy, under great duress, had finally agreed to come down to the beach—fully clothed, in her Doc Martens, and glowering. But the truth was, there was plenty of money for a vacation even without it. Because they did not need the money from the house, it was the kind of tenant that mattered to Mrs. Richardson. She wanted to feel that she was doing good with it. Her parents had brought her up to do good; they had donated every year to the Humane Society and UNICEF and always attended local fund-raisers, once winning a three-foot-tall stuffed bear at the Rotary Club’s silent auction. Mrs. Richardson looked at the house as a form of charity. She kept the rent low—real estate in Cleveland was cheap, but apartments in good neighborhoods like Shaker could be pricey—and she rented only to people she felt were deserving but who had, for one reason or another, not quite gotten a fair shot in life. It pleased her to make up the difference.\n\n\t\t\tMr. Yang had been the first tenant she’d taken after inheriting the house; he was an immigrant from Hong Kong who had come to the United States knowing no one and speaking only fragmentary, heavily accented English. Over the years his accent had diminished only marginally, and when they spoke, Mrs. Richardson was sometimes reduced to nodding and smiling. But Mr. Yang was a good man, she felt; he worked very hard, driving a school bus to Laurel Academy, a nearby private girls’ school, and working as a handyman. Living alone on such a meager income, he would never have been able to live in such a nice neighborhood. He would have ended up in a cramped, gray efficiency somewhere off Buckeye Road, or more likely in the gritty triangle of east Cleveland that passed for a Chinatown, where rent was suspiciously low, every other building was abandoned, and sirens wailed at least once a night. Plus, Mr. Yang kept the house in impeccable shape, repairing leaky faucets, patching the front concrete, and coaxing the stamp-sized backyard into a lush garden. Every summer he brought her Chinese melons he had grown, like a tithe, and although Mrs. Richardson had no idea what to do with them—they were jade green, wrinkled, and disconcertingly fuzzy—she appreciated his thoughtfulness anyway. Mr. Yang was exactly the kind of tenant Mrs. Richardson wanted: a kind person to whom she could do a kind turn, and who would appreciate her kindness.\n\n\t\t\tWith the upstairs apartment she had been less successful. The upstairs had had a new tenant every year or so: a cellist who had just been hired to teach at the Institute of Music; a divorcée in her forties; a young newlywed couple fresh out of Cleveland State. Each of them had deserved a little booster, as she’d begun to think of it. But none of them stayed long. The cellist, denied first chair in the Cleveland Orchestra, left the city in a cloud of bitterness. The divorcée remarried after a whirlwind four-month romance and moved with her new husband to a brand-new McMansion in Lakewood. And the young couple, who had seemed so sincere, so devoted, and so deeply in love, had quarreled irreparably and separated after a mere eighteen months, leaving a broken lease, some shattered vases, and three cracked spots in the wall, head-high, where those vases had shattered.\n\n\t\t\tIt was a lesson, Mrs. Richardson had decided. This time she would be more careful. She asked Mr. Yang to patch the plaster and took her time finding a new tenant, the right sort of tenant. 18434 Winslow Road Up sat empty for nearly six months until Mia Warren and her daughter came along. A single mother, well spoken, artistic, raising a daughter who was polite and fairly pretty and possibly brilliant.\n\n\t\t\t“I heard Shaker schools are the best in Cleveland,” Mia had said when Mrs. Richardson asked why they’d come to Shaker. “Pearl is working at the college level already. But I can’t afford private school.” She glanced over at Pearl, who stood quietly in the empty living room of the apartment, hands clasped in front of her, and the girl smiled shyly. Something about that look between mother and child caught Mrs. Richardson’s heart in a butterfly net. She assured Mia that yes, Shaker schools were excellent—Pearl could enroll in AP classes in every subject; there were science labs, a planetarium, five languages she could learn.\n\n\t\t\t“There’s a wonderful theatre program, if she’s interested in that,” she added. “My daughter Lexie was Helena in A Midsummer Night’s Dream last year.” She quoted the Shaker schools’ motto: A community is known by the schools it keeps. Real estate taxes in Shaker were higher than anywhere else, but residents certainly got their money’s worth. “But you’ll be renting, so of course you get all the benefits with none of the burden,” she added with a laugh. She handed Mia an application, but she’d already decided. It gave her immense satisfaction to imagine this woman and her daughter settling into the apartment, Pearl doing her homework at the kitchen table, Mia perhaps working on a painting or a sculpture—for she had not mentioned her exact medium—in the enclosed porch overlooking the backyard.\n\n\t\t\tMoody, listening to his mother describe their new tenants, was intrigued less by the artist than by the mention of the “brilliant” daughter just his age. A few days after Mia and Pearl moved in, his curiosity got the better of him. As always, he took his bike, an old fixed-gear Schwinn that had belonged to his father long ago in Indiana. Nobody biked in Shaker Heights, just as nobody took the bus: you either drove or somebody drove you; it was a town built for cars and for people who had cars. Moody biked. He wouldn’t be sixteen until spring, and he never asked Lexie or Trip to drive him anywhere if he could help it.\n\n\t\t\tHe pushed off and followed the curve of Parkland Drive, past the duck pond, where he had never seen a duck in his life, only swarms of big, brash Canadian geese; across Van Aken Boulevard and the rapid-transit tracks to Winslow Road. He didn’t come here often—none of the children had much to do with the rental house—but he knew where it was. A few times, when he was younger, he had sat in the idling car in the driveway, staring at the peach tree in the yard and skimming the radio stations while his mother ran in to drop something off or check on something. It didn’t happen often; for the most part, except when his mother was looking for tenants, the house mostly ran itself. Now he realized, as his wheels bumped over the joints between the big sandstone slabs that made up the sidewalks, that he had never been inside. He wasn’t sure any of the kids ever had.\n\n\t\t\tIn front of the house, Pearl was carefully arranging the pieces of a wooden bed on the front lawn. Moody, gliding to a stop across the street, saw a slender girl in a long, crinkly skirt and a loose T-shirt with a message he couldn’t quite read. Her hair was long and curly and hung in a thick braid down her back and gave the impression of straining to burst free. She had laid the headboard down flat near the flowerbeds that bordered the house, with the side rails below it and the slats to either side in neat rows, like ribs. It was as if the bed had drawn a deep breath and then gracefully flattened itself into the grass. Moody watched, half hidden by a tree, as she picked her way around to the Rabbit, which sat in the driveway with its doors thrown wide, and extracted the footboard from the backseat. He wondered what kind of Tetris they had done to fit all the pieces of the bed into such a small car. Her feet were bare as she crossed the lawn to set the footboard into place. Then, to his bemusement, she stepped into the empty rectangle in the center, where the mattress belonged, and flopped down on her back.\n\n\t\t\tOn the second story of the house, a window rattled open and Mia’s head peered out. “All there?”\n\n\t\t\t“Two slats missing,” Pearl called back.\n\n\t\t\t“We’ll replace them. No, wait, stay there. Don’t move.” Mia’s head disappeared again. In a moment she reappeared holding a camera, a real camera, with a thick lens like a big tin can. Pearl stayed just as she was, staring up at the half-clouded sky, and Mia leaned out almost to the waist, angling for the right shot. Moody held his breath, afraid the camera might slip from her hands onto her daughter’s trusting upturned face, that she might tumble over the sill herself and come crashing down into the grass. None of this happened. Mia’s head tilted this way and that, framing the scene below in her viewfinder. The camera hid her face, hid everything but her hair, piled in a frizzy swirl atop her head like a dark halo. Later, when Moody saw the finished photos, he thought at first that Pearl looked like a delicate fossil, something caught for millennia in the skeleton belly of a prehistoric beast. Then he thought she looked like an angel resting with her wings spread out behind her. And then, after a moment, she looked simply like a girl asleep in a lush green bed, waiting for her lover to lie down beside her.\n\n\t\t\t“All right,” Mia called down. “Got it.” She slid back inside, and Pearl sat up and looked across the street, directly at Moody, and his heart jumped.\n\n\t\t\t“You want to help?” she said. “Or just stand there?”\n\n\t\t\tMoody would never remember crossing the street, or propping his bike in the front walkway, or introducing himself. So it would feel to him that he had always known her name, and that she had always known his, that somehow, he and Pearl had known each other always.\n\n\t\t\tTogether they ferried the pieces of the bed frame up the narrow stairway. The living room was empty except for a stack of boxes in one corner and a large red cushion in the center of the floor.\n\n\t\t\t“This way.” Pearl tugged her armful of bed slats higher and led Moody into the larger bedroom, which held nothing except a faded but clean twin mattress leaning against one wall.\n\n\t\t\t“Here,” said Mia, depositing a steel toolbox at Pearl’s feet. “You’ll want these.” She gave Moody a smile, as if he were an old friend. “Call me if you need another set of hands.” Then she stepped back into the hallway, and in a moment they heard the snick of a box being slit open.\n\n\t\t\tPearl wielded the tools with expert hands, levering the side panels into place against the headboard, propping them up on one ankle while she bolted them into place. Moody sat beside the open toolbox and watched her with unfolding awe. In his house, if something broke, his mother called a repairman to fix it—the stove, the washer, the disposal—or, for almost anything else, it was discarded and replaced. Every three or four years, or when the springs began to sag, his mother picked a new living room set, the old set moved into the basement rec room, and the old-old set from the rec room was given away to the juvenile boys’ home on the West Side, or to the women’s shelter downtown. His father did not tinker with the car in the garage; when it rattled or squealed he brought it to the Lusty Wrench, where Luther had tended to every car the Richardsons had owned for the past twenty years. The only time he himself had handled any tools, Moody realized, was in eighth-grade shop: they’d been put in groups, one team measuring and one sawing and one sanding, and at the end of the term everyone dutifully screwed their pieces together to make a little box-shaped candy dispenser that gave you three Skittles every time you pulled the handle. Trip had made an identical one in shop the year before and Lexie had made an identical one the year before that and Izzy made yet another the following year, and despite the whole term of shop, despite the four identical candy dispensers stashed somewhere in their house, Moody was not sure that anyone in the Richardson household could do more than work a Phillips screwdriver.\n\n\t\t\t“How’d you learn to do all that?” he asked, handing Pearl another bed slat.\n\n\t\t\tPearl shrugged. “From my mom,” she said, pinning the slat in place with one hand and plucking a screw from the pile on the carpet.\n\n\t\t\tThe bed, when assembled, proved to be an old-fashioned twin with bed knobs, the kind Goldilocks might have slept in.\n\n\t\t\t“Where’d you get it?” Moody set the mattress in place and gave it an experimental bounce.\n\n\t\t\tPearl replaced the screwdriver in the toolbox and latched it shut. “We found it.”\n\n\t\t\tShe sat down on the bed, back propped against the footboard, legs stretched along the bed’s length, gazing up at the ceiling, as if testing it out. Moody sat down at the head of the bed, near her feet. Wisps of grass stuck to her toes and her calves and the hem of her skirt. She smelled like fresh air and mint shampoo.\n\n\t\t\t“This is my room,” Pearl said suddenly, and Moody sprang up again. “Sorry,” he said, a hot flush rising to his cheeks.\n\n\t\t\tPearl glanced up, as if for a moment she’d forgotten he was there. “Oh,” she said. “That’s not what I meant.” She picked a sliver of grass from between her toes and flicked it away and they watched it settle on the carpet. When she began again, her tone was one of wonder. “I’ve never had my own room before.”\n\n\t\t\tMoody turned her words over in his mind. “You mean you always had to share?” He tried to imagine a world where this was possible. He tried to imagine sharing a room with Trip, who littered the floor with dirty socks and sports magazines, whose first action when he came home was to snap the radio on—always to “Jammin” 92.3—as if without that inane bass thumping, his heart might not beat. On vacation, the Richardsons always booked three rooms: one for Mr. and Mrs. Richardson, one for Lexie and Izzy, one for Trip and Moody—and at breakfast Trip would make fun of Moody for sometimes talking in his sleep. For Pearl and her mother to have had to share a room—Moody almost could not believe that people could be so poor.\n\n\t\t\tPearl shook her head. “We’ve never had a house of our own before,” she said, and Moody stifled the urge to tell her that this wasn’t a house, it was only half a house. She traced the dips of the mattress with her fingertip, circling the buttons in each dimple.\n\n\t\t\tWatching her, Moody could not see all that she was remembering: the finicky stove in Urbana, which they’d had to light with a match; the fifth-floor walk-up in Middlebury and the weed-choked garden in Ocala and the smoky apartment in Muncie, where the previous tenant had let his pet rabbit roam the living room, leaving gnawed-in holes and several questionable stains. And the sublet in Ann Arbor, years ago now, that she’d most hated to leave, because the people who’d lived there had had a daughter just a year or two older than she was, and every day of the six months she and her mother had lived there she had played with that lucky girl’s collection of horse figurines and sat in her child-sized armchair and lain in her white-frosted canopy bed to sleep, and sometimes, in the middle of the night when her mother was asleep, she would turn on the bedside light and open that girl’s closet and try on her dresses and her shoes, even though they were all a little too big. There had been photos of that girl everywhere in the house—on the mantel, on the end tables in the living room, in the stairwell a big, beautiful studio portrait of her with chin in hand—and it had been so easy for Pearl to pretend that this was her house and that these were her things, her room, her life. When the couple and their daughter had returned from their sabbatical, Pearl had not even been able to look at the girl, tanned and wiry and too tall now for those dresses in the closet. She had cried all the way to Lafayette, where they would stay for the next eight months, and even the prancing china palomino she had stolen from the girl’s collection gave her no comfort, for though she waited nervously, there was never any complaint about the loss, and what could be less satisfying than stealing from someone so endowed that they never even noticed what you’d taken? Her mother must have understood, for they didn’t sublet again. Pearl hadn’t complained either, knowing now that she preferred an empty apartment to one filled with someone else’s things.\n\n\t\t\t“We move around a lot. Whenever my mom gets the bug.” She looked at him fiercely, almost a glare, and Moody saw that her eyes, which he’d thought were hazel, were a deep jade green. At that moment Moody had a sudden clear understanding of what had already happened that morning: his life had been divided into a before and an after, and he would always be comparing the two.\n\n\t\t\t“What are you doing tomorrow?” he asked.\n\n\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next few weeks became a series of tomorrows for Moody. They went to Fernway, his old elementary school, where they clambered up the slide and shimmied up the pole and tumbled from the catwalk to the wood chips below. He took Pearl to Draeger’s for hot fudge sundaes. At Horseshoe Lake, they climbed trees like children, throwing stale chunks of bread to the ducks bobbing below. In Yours Truly, the local diner, they sat in a high-backed wooden booth and ate fries smothered in cheese and bacon and fed quarters into the jukebox to play “Great Balls of Fire” and “Hey Jude.”\n\n\t\t\t“Take me to see the Shakers,” Pearl suggested one day, and Moody laughed.\n\n\t\t\t“There aren’t any Shakers in Shaker Heights,” he said. “They all died out. Didn’t believe in sex. They just named the town after them.”\n\n\t\t\tMoody was half right, though neither he nor most of the kids in the town knew much about its history. The Shakers had indeed left the land that would become Shaker Heights long before, and by the summer of 1997 there were exactly twelve left in the world. But Shaker Heights had been founded, if not on Shaker principles, with the same idea of creating a utopia. Order—and regulation, the father of order—had been the Shakers’ key to harmony. They had regulated everything: the proper time for rising in the morning, the proper color of window curtains, the proper length of a man’s hair, the proper way to fold one’s hands in prayer (right thumb over left). If they planned every detail, the Shakers had believed, they could create a patch of heaven on earth, a little refuge from the world, and the founders of Shaker Heights had thought the same. In advertisements they depicted Shaker Heights in the clouds, looking down upon the grimy city of Cleveland from a mountaintop at the end of a rainbow’s arch. Perfection: that was the goal, and perhaps the Shakers had lived it so strongly it had seeped into the soil itself, feeding those who grew up there with a propensity to overachieve and a deep intolerance for flaws. Even the teens of Shaker Heights—whose main exposure to Shakers was singing “Simple Gifts” in music class—could feel that drive for perfection still in the air.\n\n\t\t\tAs Pearl learned more about her new hometown, Moody began to learn more about Mia’s art, and the intricacies and vagaries of the Warren family finances.\n\n\t\t\tMoody had never thought much about money, because he had never needed to. Lights went on when he flipped switches; water came out when he turned the tap. Groceries appeared in the refrigerator at regular intervals and reappeared as cooked meals on the table at mealtimes. He had had an allowance since he was ten, starting at five dollars per week and increasing steadily with inflation and age up to its current twenty dollars. Between that and birthday cards from aunts and relatives, each reliably containing a folded bill, he had enough for a used book from Mac’s Backs, or the occasional CD, or new guitar strings, whatever he felt he needed.\n\n\t\t\tMia and Pearl got as much as they could used—or better yet, free. In just a few weeks, they’d learned the location of every Salvation Army store, St. Vincent de Paul’s, and Goodwill in the greater Cleveland area. The week they’d arrived, Mia had gotten a job at Lucky Palace, a local Chinese restaurant; several afternoons and evenings a week, she took and packaged up takeout orders at the counter. They soon learned that for dining out, everyone in Shaker seemed to prefer Pearl of the Orient, just a few blocks away, but Lucky Palace did a good takeout business. In addition to Mia’s hourly pay, the servers gave her a share of their tips, and when there was extra food, she took a few containers home—slightly stale rice, leftover sweet-and-sour pork, vegetables just past their prime—which sustained her and Pearl for most of the week. They had very little, but that wasn’t immediately obvious: Mia was good at repurposing. Lo mein, without its sauce, was topped with Ragú from a jar one night, reheated and topped with orange beef another. Old bedsheets, purchased for a quarter each at the thrift store, turned into curtains, a tablecloth, pillow covers. Moody thought of math class: a practical application of combinatorics. How many different ways could you combine mu shu pancakes and fillings? How many different combinations could you make with rice, pork, and peppers?\n\n\t\t\t“Why doesn’t your mom get a real job?” Moody asked Pearl one afternoon. “I bet she could get more hours a week. Or maybe even a full-time spot at Pearl of the Orient, or some other place.” He had wondered this all week, ever since he’d learned about Mia’s job. If she took on more hours, he reasoned, she would make enough for them to have a real sofa, real meals, perhaps a TV.\n\n\t\t\tPearl stared, brow furrowed, as if she simply did not understand the question.\n\n\t\t\t“But she has a job,” she said. “She’s an artist.”\n\n\t\t\tThey had lived this way for years, with Mia taking a part-time job that earned just enough for them to get by. For as long as she could remember, Pearl had understood the hierarchy: her mother’s real work was her art, and whatever paid the bills existed only to make that art possible. Her mother spent several hours every day working—though at first Moody had not realized this was what she was doing. Sometimes she was downstairs in the makeshift darkroom she’d rigged up in the basement laundry room, developing rolls of film or making prints. Sometimes she seemed to spend all her time reading—things that weren’t obviously relevant to Moody, like cooking magazines from the 1960s, or car manuals, or an immense hardcover biography of Eleanor Roosevelt from the library—or even staring out the living room window at the tree just outside it. One morning when he arrived, Mia was toying with a loop of string, playing cat’s cradle, and when they returned she was still at it, weaving ever more complicated nets between her fingers and then suddenly unraveling them back into a single loop and beginning again. “Part of the process,” Pearl informed him as they cut through the living room, with the nonchalant air of a native unfazed by the curious customs of the land.\n\n\t\t\tSometimes Mia went out with her camera, but more often she might spend days, or even weeks, preparing something to photograph, with the actual taking of the photographs lasting only a few hours. For Mia, Moody learned, did not consider herself a photographer. Photography, at its heart, was about documentation, and he soon understood that for Mia photography was simply a tool, which she used as a painter might use a brush or a knife.\n\n\t\t\tA plain photograph might be doctored later: with embroidered carnival masks obscuring the faces of the people within, or the figures themselves might be clipped out, paper-doll style, and dressed in clothes cut from fashion magazines. In one set of photos, Mia rinsed the negatives before making prints that were oddly distorted—a photo of a clean kitchen speckled with spots from lemonade; a photo of laundry on the clothesline rendered ghostlike and warped by bleach. In another set, she carefully double-exposed each frame—layering a far-off skyscraper over the middle finger of her hand; superimposing a dead bird, wings akimbo on the pavement, over a blue sky, so that except for the closed eyes, it looked as if it were flying.\n\n\t\t\tShe worked unconventionally, keeping only photos she liked and tossing the rest. When the idea was exhausted, she kept a single print of each shot and destroyed the negatives. “I’m not interested in syndication,” she said to Moody rather airily, when he asked why she didn’t make multiples. She seldom photographed people—occasionally, she would take a picture of Pearl, as with the bed on the lawn, but she never used them in her work. She never used herself either: once, Pearl told Moody, she had done a series of self-portraits, wearing different objects as masks—a piece of black lace, five-fingered horse-chestnut leaves, a damp and pliant starfish—had spent a month on these photos, narrowing them down to a set of eight. They’d been beautiful and eerie, and even now Pearl could see them exactly: her mother’s bright eye like a pearl peeking out between the legs of the starfish. But at the last moment Mia had burned the prints and negatives, for reasons even Pearl could not fathom. “You spent all that time,” she’d said, “and just pfft”—she snapped her fingers—“like that?”\n\n\t\t\t“They weren’t working” was all Mia would say.\n\n\t\t\tBut the pictures she did keep, and sold, were startling.\n\n\t\t\tIn their luxurious sublet in Ann Arbor, Mia had taken various pieces of her hosts’ furniture apart and arranged the components—bolts as thick as her finger, unvarnished crossbeams, disembodied feet—into animals. A bulky secretary desk from the nineteenth century transformed into a bull, the sides of the disassembled drawers forming muscled legs, the cast-iron knobs of its drawer pulls serving as the bull’s nose and eyes and glinting balls, a handful of pens from inside the desk fanned out into the crescents of horns. With Pearl’s help, she had laid the pieces out on the cream-colored Persian carpet, which as a backdrop looked like a field fogged with steam, and then she had climbed on top of a table to photograph it from above before they picked it back apart and reassembled it into a desk. An old Chinese birdcage, broken down into a web of arched wires, had become an eagle, its brassy skeletal wings spread as if about to take flight. An overstuffed sofa had become an elephant, trunk raised in trumpet song. The series of photos that emerged from this project were both intriguing and unsettling, the animals incredibly intricate and lifelike, and then you looked closer and realized what they had been made of. She had sold quite a few of these, through her friend Anita, a gallery owner in New York—a person Pearl had never met in a place she’d never been. Mia hated New York, would never go even to promote her own work. “Anita,” Mia had said into the phone once, “I love you dearly but I cannot come to New York for a show. No, not even if it meant I’d sell a hundred pieces.” A pause. “I know it does, but you know I can’t. All right. You do what you can, and that’s good enough for me.” Still, Anita had managed to sell a half dozen of the series, which meant instead of cleaning houses Mia had been able to spend the next six months working on a new project.\n\n\t\t\tThat was how her mother worked: one project for four or six months, then on to the next. She’d work and work and come up with a group of photos and Anita would usually be able to sell at least a few of them in her gallery. At first the prices had been so modest—a few hundred dollars per piece—that Mia sometimes had to take on two jobs, or even three. But as time went on, her work became regarded well enough in the art world that Anita could sell more pieces, for more money: enough to pay for what Mia and Pearl needed—food, rent, gas for the Rabbit—even after Anita’s fifty-percent cut. “Two or three thousand dollars, sometimes,” Pearl told him with pride, and Moody did quick mental math: if Mia sold ten pictures a year . . .\n\n\t\t\tSometimes the photos did not sell—a project Mia did with skeletal leaves sold only one, and for several months she took up a series of odd jobs: housecleaning, flower arranging, cake decorating. She was good at anything that involved her hands, and she preferred the jobs where she did not have to work with customers, where she could be alone and thinking, to waitressing, secretarying, salesclerking. “I was a salesgirl once, before you were born,” she told Pearl. “I lasted one day. One. The manager kept telling me how to put the dresses on hangers. Customers would pull the beads off clothes and demand discounts. I’d rather mop a floor, alone in the house, than deal with that.”\n\n\t\t\tBut other projects did sell, and got attention. One series—which Mia began after she’d been doing some seamstress work—supported them for nearly a year. She would go to thrift stores and buy old stuffed animals—faded teddy bears, ratty plush dogs, threadbare rabbits—the cheaper the better. At home, she took them apart at the seams, washed their pelts, fluffed their filling, repolished their eyes. Then she stitched them back together, inside out, and the results were eerily beautiful. The ragged fur, in reverse, took on the look of shorn velvet. The whole animal, resewn and restuffed, had the same shape but a different bearing, the backs and necks straighter, the ears perkier; the eyes shone now with a knowing glint. It was as if the animal had been reincarnated, older and bolder and wiser. Pearl had loved watching her mother at work, bent over the kitchen table, laboring with the precision of a surgeon—scalpel, needle, pins—to transform these toys into art. Anita had sold every photo in this series; one had even, she reported, made its way to MoMA. She’d begged Mia to take another round, or to reprint the series, but Mia had refused. “The idea is done,” she said. “I’m working on something else now.” And she always was, always something a bit different, always something that had struck her fancy. She would be famous someday, Pearl was certain; someday her adored mother would be one of those artists, like de Kooning or Warhol or O’Keeffe, whose name everyone knew. It was why part of her, at least, didn’t mind the life they’d always lived, their thrift-store clothes, their salvaged beds and chairs, the shifting precariousness of it all. One day everyone would see her mother’s brilliance.\n\n\t\t\tTo Moody, this kind of existence was all but unfathomable. Watching the Warrens live was like watching a magic trick, as miraculous as transforming an empty soda can into a silver pitcher, or pulling a steaming pie from a silk top hat. No, he thought: it was like watching Robinson Crusoe conjure up a living out of nothingness. The more time he spent with Mia and Pearl, the more fascinated he became with them.\n\n\t\t\tThrough his afternoons with Pearl, Moody slowly learned some of what their life on the road was like. They traveled lightly: two plates and two cups and a handful of mismatched silverware; a duffel of clothes each; and, of course, Mia’s cameras. In the summer, they drove with the windows down, for the Rabbit had no air-conditioning; in the winter, they drove by night, the heat cranked up, and in the daytime would park in a sunny spot, sleeping in the snug greenhouse of the car before starting again as the sun set. At night, Mia pushed the bags into the footwells and laid a folded army blanket across them and the backseat, forming a bed that could just hold them both. For privacy, they draped a sheet from the hatchback over the headrests of the front seats to make a little tent. At mealtimes they stopped by the side of the road, feeding themselves from the paper bag of groceries behind the driver’s seat: bread and peanut butter, fruit, sometimes salami or a stick of pepperoni, if Mia found it on sale. Sometimes they drove for just a few days, sometimes for a week, until Mia found a spot that felt right, and they would stop.\n\n\t\t\tThey would find an apartment for rent: usually a studio, sometimes an efficiency, whatever they could afford and wherever they could go month to month, for Mia did not like to be tied down. They would set up their new apartment as they had in Shaker, with castoffs and thrift-store finds made fresh, or at least tolerable; Mia would enroll Pearl in the local school and find work enough to support them. And then Mia would begin her next project, working, worrying the idea like a bone, for three months or four or six months, until she had a set of photographs to dispatch to Anita in New York City.\n\n\t\t\tShe would set up a darkroom in the bathroom, after Pearl had fallen asleep. After the first few moves, she’d gotten it down to a science: trays for washing prints in the bathtub, a clothesline for drying strung from the shower rod, a rolled-up towel across the bottom of the door to block out any extra light. When she was finished, she stacked her trays, folded her enlarger into its case, hid her jugs of chemicals under the sink, and scrubbed the bathtub so that it was sparkling for Pearl’s shower the next morning. She would crack the bathroom window and go to bed, and by the time Pearl woke, the sour smell of developer would be gone. Once Mia mailed her photographs, Pearl always knew, they would pack up the car again and the entire process would repeat. One town, one project, and then it was time to move on.\n\n\t\t\tThis time, though, was to be different. “We’re staying put,” Pearl told him, and Moody felt suddenly, giddily buoyant, like an overfilled balloon. “My mom promised. This time we’re staying for good.”\n\n\t\t\tTheir itinerant, artistic lifestyle appealed to him: Moody was a romantic at heart. He made the honor roll every semester, but unburdened by practicalities, he had daydreams about leaving school, traveling the country à la Jack Kerouac—only writing songs instead of poems. Mac’s Backs supplied him with well-worn copies of On the Road and Dharma Bums, the poems of Frank O’Hara and Rainer Maria Rilke and Pablo Neruda, and to his delight he found in Pearl another poetic soul. She hadn’t read as much as he had, of course, because they had moved so often, but she had spent most of her childhood in libraries, taking refuge among the shelves as a new girl bouncing from school to school, absorbing books as if they were air—and, in fact, she told him shyly, she wanted to be a poet. She copied her favorite poems into a beat-up spiral notebook that she kept with her at all times. “So they’ll always be with me,” she said, and when she finally allowed Moody to read some of them, he was speechless. He wanted to twine himself in the tiny curlicues of her handwriting. “Beautiful,” he sighed, and Pearl’s face lit up like a lantern, and the next day Moody brought his guitar, taught her to play three chords, and bashfully sang one of his songs for her, which he’d never sung for anyone else.\n\n\t\t\tPearl, he soon discovered, had a fantastic memory. She could remember passages after reading them through just once, could recall the dates of the Magna Carta and the names of the kings of England and every one of the presidents in order. Moody’s grades came from meticulous studying and plenty of flash cards, but everything seemed to come easily to Pearl: she could glance at a math problem and intuit the answer while Moody dutifully worked line after line of algebra down the page; she could read an essay and put her finger, at once, on the most salient point or the biggest logical flaw. It was as if she had glanced at a pile of jigsaw puzzle pieces and saw the whole picture without even consulting the box. Pearl’s mind, it became clear, was an extraordinary thing, and Moody could not help but admire how fast her brain worked, how effortlessly. It was a pure pleasure, watching her click everything into place.\n\n\t\t\tThe more time they spent together, the more Moody began to feel he was in two places at once. At any given moment—every moment he could arrange, in fact—he was there with Pearl, in the booth at the diner, in the fork of a tree, watching her big eyes drink in everything around them as if she were ferociously thirsty. He would crack dumb jokes and tell stories and dredge up bits of trivia, anything to make her smile. And at the same time, in his mind, he was roaming the city, searching desperately for the next place he could take her, the next wonder of suburban Cleveland he could display, because when he ran out of places to show her, he was sure, she would disappear. Already he thought he saw her growing silent over their fries, prodding the last congealed lump of cheese on the plate; already he was sure her eyes were drifting across the lake to the far shore.\n\n\t\t\tThis was how Moody made a decision he would question for the rest of his life. Until now he had said nothing about Pearl or her mother to his family, guarding their friendship like a dragon guards treasure: silently, greedily. Deep down he had the feeling that somehow it would change everything, the way in fairy tales magic was spoiled if you shared the secret. If he had kept her to himself, perhaps the future might have been quite different. Pearl might never have met his mother or his father, or Lexie or Trip or Izzy, or if she had, they might have been people she only greeted but didn’t know. She and her mother might have stayed in Shaker forever, as they’d planned; eleven months later, the Richardson house might still have been standing. But Moody did not think of himself as interesting enough to hold her attention in his own right. Had he been a different Richardson, it might have been different; his brother and sisters never worried whether other people would like them. Lexie had her golden smile and her easy laugh, Trip had his looks and his dimples: why wouldn’t people like them, why would they ever even ask such a thing? For Izzy, it was even simpler: she didn’t care what people thought of her. But Moody did not possess Lexie’s warmth, Trip’s roguish charm, Izzy’s self-confidence. All he had to offer her, he felt, was what his family had to offer, his family itself, and it was this that led him to say, one afternoon in late July, “Come over. You can meet my family.”", "characters": [{"name": "Mia Warren", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Mia"]}, {"name": "Pearl Warren", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Pearl"]}, {"name": "Elena Richardson", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Mrs. Richardson"]}, {"name": "Bill Richardson", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Mr. Richardson"]}, {"name": "Moody Richardson", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Moody"]}, {"name": "Lexie Richardson", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Lexie"]}, {"name": "Trip Richardson", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Trip"]}, {"name": "Isabelle Richardson", "role": "SUPPORTING", "aliases": ["Izzy"]}, {"name": "Mr. Yang", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Anita", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0012}}
