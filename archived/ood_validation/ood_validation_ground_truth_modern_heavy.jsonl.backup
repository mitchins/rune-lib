Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune; four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!\"\n\n\"How so? How can it affect them?\"\n\n\"My dear Mr. Bennet,\" replied his wife, \"how can you be so tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.\"\n\n\"Is that his design in settling here?\"\n\n\"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them, and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.\"\n\n\"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.\"\n\n\"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.\"\n\n\"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of.\"\n\n\"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.\"\n\n\"It is more than I engage for, I assure you.\"\n\n\"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.\"\n\nElizabeth entered the room at that moment, having heard her parents' animated discussion from the hallway. She had been reading in the garden when the sound of her mother's excited voice drew her inside.\n\n\"What are you discussing so intently?\" Elizabeth asked, taking a seat near the window.\n\nMrs. Bennet immediately launched into her explanation about Mr. Bingley, while Mr. Bennet watched his second daughter with an amused expression. Elizabeth listened patiently to her mother's enthusiastic description of their new neighbor's fortune and eligibility.\n\nMeanwhile, Mary was practicing at the pianoforte in the next room, her diligent scales providing a steady background to the conversation. Kitty and Lydia could be heard laughing together upstairs, no doubt planning some mischief.

{"story_id": "colour_of_magic_extract", "text": "Fire roared through the bifurcated city of Ankh-Morpork. Where it licked the Wizards' Quarter it burned blue and green and was even laced with strange sparks of the eighth colour, octarine; where its outriders found their way into the vats and oil stores all along Merchants Street it progressed in a series of blazing fountains and explosions; in the Streets of the perfume blenders it burned with a sweetness; where it touched bundles of rare and dry herbs in the storerooms of the drugmasters it made men go mad and talk to God.\n\n By now the whole of downtown Ankh-Morpork was alight, and the richer and worthier citizens of Ankh on the far bank were bravely responding to the situation by feverishly demolishing the bridges. But already the ships in the Morpork docks - laden with grain, cotton and timber, and coated with tar - were blazing merrily and, their moorings burnt to ashes, were breasting the river Ankh on the ebb tide, igniting riverside palaces and bowers as they drifted like drowning fireflies towards the sea. In any case, sparks were riding the breeze and touching down far across the river in hidden gardens and remote brickyards. The smoke from the merry burning rose miles high, in a wind-sculpted black column that could be seen across the whole of the Discworld. It was certainly impressive from the cool, dark hilltop a few leagues away, where two figures were watching with considerable interest.\n\n The taller of the pair was chewing on a chicken leg and leaning on a sword that was only marginally shorter than the average man. If it wasn't for the air of wary intelligence about him it might have been supposed that he was a barbarian from the hubland wastes.\n\n His partner was much shorter and wrapped from head to toe in a brown cloak. Later, when he has occasion to move, it will be seen that he moves lightly, cat-like.\n\n The two had barely exchanged a word in the last twenty minutes except for a short and inconclusive argument as to whether a particularly powerful explosion had been the oil bond store or the workshop of Kerible the Enchanter. Money hinged on the fact.\n\n Now the big man finished gnawing at the bone and tossed it into the grass, smiling ruefully.\n\n \"There go all those little alleyways,\" he said. \"I liked them.\"\n\n \"All the treasure houses,\" said the small man. He added thoughtfully, \"Do gems burn, I wonder? 'Tis said they're kin to coal.\"\n\n \"All the gold, melting and running down the gutters,\" said the big one, ignoring him. \"And all the wine, boiling in the barrels.\"\n\n \"There were rats,\" said his brown companion.\n\n \"Rats, I'll grant you.\"\n\n \"It was no place to be in high summer.\"\n\n \"That, too. One can't help feeling, though, a well, a momentary-\"\n\n He trailed off, then brightened. \"We owed old Fredor at the Crimson Leech eight silver pieces,\" he added. The little man nodded.\n\n They were silent for a while as a whole new series of explosions carved a red line across a hitherto dark section of the greatest city in the world. Then the big man stirred\n\n \"Weasel?\"\n\n \"Yes?\"\n\n \"I wonder who started it?\"\n\n The small swordsman known as the Weasel said nothing. He was watching the road in the ruddy light. Few had come that way since the widershins gate had been one of the first to collapse in a shower of white-hot embers.\n\n But two were coming up it now. The Weasel's eyes always at their sharpest in gloom and halflight, made out the shapes of two mounted men and some sort of low beast behind them. Doubtless a rich merchant escaping with as much treasure as he could lay frantic hands on. The Weasel said as much to his companion, who sighed.\n\n \"The status of footpad ill suits us,\" said the barbarian, \"but as you say, times are hard and there are no soft beds tonight.\"\n\n He shifted his grip on his sword and, as the leading rider drew near, stepped out onto the road with a hand held up and his face set in a grin nicely calculated to reassure yet threaten.\n\n \"Your pardon, sir-\" he began.\n\n The rider reined in his horse and drew back his hood. The big man looked into a face blotched with superficial burns and punctuated by tufts of singed beard. Even the eyebrows had gone.\n\n \"Bugger off,\" said the face. \"You're Bravd the Hublander, aren't you?\"\n\n Bravd became aware that he had fumbled the initiative.\n\n \"Just go away, will you?\" said the rider. \"I just haven't got time for you, do you understand?\" He looked around and added: \"That goes for your shadow-loving fleabag partner too, wherever he's hiding.\"\n\n The Weasel stepped up to the horse and peered at the dishevelled figure.\n\n \"Why, it's Rincewind the wizard, isn't it?\" he said in tones of delight, meanwhile filing the wizard's description of him in his memory for leisurely vengeance. \"I thought I recognized the voice.\"\n\n Bravd spat and sheathed his sword. It was seldom worth tangling with wizards, they so rarely had any treasure worth speaking of.\n\n \"He talks pretty big for a gutter wizard,\" he muttered.\n\n \"You don't understand at all,\" said the wizard wearily. \"I\u00edm so scared of you my spine has turned to jelly, it's just that I\u00edm suffering from an overdose of terror right now. I mean, when I\u00edve got over that then I'll have time to be decently frightened of you.\"\n\n The Weasel pointed towards the burning city. \"You\u00edve been through that?\" he asked.\n\n The wizard rubbed a red, raw hand across his eyes. \"I was there when it started. See him? Back there?\" He pointed back down the road to where his travelling companion was still approaching, having adopted a method of riding that involved falling out of the saddle every few seconds.\n\n \"Well?\" said Weasel.\n\n \"He started it,\" said Rincewind simply. Bravd and Weasel looked at the figure, now hopping across the road with one foot in a stirrup.\n\n \"Fire-raiser, is he?\" said Bravd at last.\n\n \"No,\" said Rincewind. \"Not precisely. Let's just say that if complete and utter chaos was lightning, then he'd be the sort to stand on a hilltop in a thunderstorm wearing wet copper armour and shouting \"All gods are bastards\". Got any food?\"\n\n \"There's some chicken,\" said Weasel. \"in exchange for a story.\"\n\n \"What's his name?\" said Bravd, who tended to lag behind in conversations.\n\n \"Twoflower.\"\n\n \"Twoflower?\" said Bravd. \"What a funny name.\"\n\n \"You,\" said Rincewind, dismounting, \"do not know the half of it. Chicken, you say?\"\n\n \"Devilled,\" said Weasel. The wizard groaned.\n\n \"That reminds me,\" added the Weasel, snapping his fingers, \"there was a really big explosion about, oh, half an hour ago.\"\n\n \"That was the oil bond store going up,\" said Rincewind, wincing at the memory of the burning rain.\n\n Weasel turned and grinned expectantly at his companion, who grunted and handed over a coin from his pouch. Then there was a scream from the roadway, cut off abruptly. Rincewind did not look up from his chicken.\n\n \"One of the things he can't do, he can't ride a horse,\" he said. Then he stiffened as if sandbagged by a sudden recollection, gave a small yelp of terror and dashed into the gloom. When he returned, the being called Twoflower was hanging limply over his shoulder. It was small and skinny, and dressed very oddly in a pair of knee length britches and a shirt in such a violent and vivid conflict of colours that Weasel's fastidious eye was offended even in the half-light.\n\n \"No bones broken, by the feel of things,\" said Rincewind. He was breathing heavily. Bravd winked at the Weasel and went to investigate the shape that they assumed was a pack animal.\n\n \"You'd be wise to forget it,\" said the wizard, without looking up from his examination of the unconscious Twoflower. \"Believe me. A power protects it.\"\n\n \"A spell?\" said Weasel, squatting down.\n\n \"No-oo. But magic of a kind, I think. Not the usual sort. I mean, it can turn gold into copper while at the same time it is still gold, it makes men rich by destroying their possessions, it allows the weak to walk fearlessly among thieves, it passes through the strongest doors to leach the most protected treasuries. Even now it has me enslaved - so that I must follow this madman willynilly and protect him from harm. It's stronger than you, Bravd. It is, I think, more cunning even than you, Weasel.\"\n\n \"What is it called then, this mighty magic?\"\n\n Rincewind shrugged. \"in our tongue it is reflected-sound-as-of-underground-spirits. Is there any wine?\"\n\n \"You must know that I am not without artifice where magic is concerned,\" said Weasel. \"only last year did I\u00f1 assisted by my friend there \u00f1 part the notoriously powerful Archmage of Ymitury from his staff, his belt of moon jewels and his life, in that approximate order. I do not fear this reflected-sound-of-underground-spirits of which you speak. However,\" he added, \"you engage my interest. Perhaps you would care to tell me more?\"\n\n Bravd looked at the shape on the road. It was closer now, and clearer in the pre-dawn light. It looked for all the world like a\u00f1\n\n \"A box on legs?\" he said.\n\n \"I'll tell you about it,\" said Rincewind. \"if there's any wine, that is.\"\n\n Down in the valley there was a roar and a hiss. Someone more thoughtful than the rest had ordered to be shut the big river gates that were at the point where the Ankh flowed out of the twin city. Denied its usual egress, the river had burst its banks and was pouring down the fire-ravaged streets. Soon the continent of flame became a series of islands, each one growing smaller as the dark tide rose. And up from the city of fumes and smoke rose a broiling cloud of steam, covering the stars. Weasel thought that it looked like some dark fungus or mushroom.\n\n The twin city of proud Ankh and pestilent Morpork, of which all the other cities of time and space are, as it were, mere reflections, has stood many assaults in its long and crowded history and has always risen to flourish again. So the fire and its subsequent flood, which destroyed everything left that was not flammable and added a particularly noisome flux to the survivors' problems, did not mark its end. Rather it was a fiery punctuation mark, a coal-like comma, or salamander semicolon, in a continuing story.\n\n Several days before these events a ship came up the Ankh on the dawn tide and fetched up, among many others, in the maze of wharves and docks on the Morpork shore. It carried a cargo of pink pearls, milk-nuts, pumice, some official letters for the Patrician of Ankh, and a man.\n\n It was the man who engaged the attention of Blind Hugh, one of the beggars on early duty at Pearl Dock. He nudged Cripple Wa in the ribs, and pointed wordlessly.\n\n Now the stranger was standing on the quayside watching several straining seamen carry a large brass-bound chest down the gangplank. Another man, obviously the captain, was standing beside him. There was about the seaman - every nerve in Blind Hugh's body, which tended to vibrate in the presence of even a small amount of impure gold at fifty paces, screamed into his brain - the air of one anticipating imminent enrichment.\n\n Sure enough, when the chest had been deposited on the cobbles, the stranger reached into a pouch and there was the flash of a coin. Several coins. Gold. Blind Hugh, his body twanging like a hazel rod in the presence of water, whistled to himself. Then he nudged Wa again, and sent him scurrying off down a nearby alley into the heart of the city. When the captain walked back onto his ship, leaving the newcomer looking faintly bewildered on the quayside, Blind Hugh snatched up his begging cup and made his way across the street with an ingratiating leer. At the sight of him the stranger started to fumble urgently with his money pouch.\n\n \"Good day to thee, sire,\" Blind Hugh began, and found himself looking up into a face with four eyes in it. He turned to run\u00d6\n\n \"!\" said the stranger, and grabbed his arm. Hugh was aware that the sailors lining the rail of the ship were laughing at him. At the same time his specialised senses detected an overpowering impression of money. He froze. The stranger let go and quickly thumbed through a small black book he had taken from his belt. Then he said \"Hallo.\"\n\n \"What?\" said Hugh. The man looked blank.\n\n \"Hallo?\" he repeated, rather louder than necessary and so carefully that Hugh could hear the vowels tinkling into place.\n\n \"Hallo yourself,\" Hugh riposted. The stranger smiled widely, fumbled yet again in the pouch. This time his hand came out holding a large gold coin. It was in fact slightly larger than an 8,000-dollar Ankhian crown and the design on it was unfamiliar, but it spoke inside Hugh's mind in a language he understood perfectly. My current owner, it said, is in need of succour and assistance; why not give it to him, so you and me can go off somewhere and enjoy ourselves?\n\n Subtle changes in the beggar's posture made the stranger feel more at ease. He consulted the small book again.\n\n \"I wish to be directed to an hotel, tavern, lodging house, inn, hospice, caravanserai,\" he said.\n\n \"What, all of them?\" said Hugh, taken aback.\n\n \"?\" said the stranger.\n\n Hugh was aware that a small crowd of fishwives, shellfish diggers and freelance gawpers were watching them with interest.\n\n \"Look,\" he said, \"I know a good tavern, is that enough?\" He shuddered to think of the gold coin escaping from his life. He'd keep that one, even if Ymor confiscated all the rest. And the big chest that comprised most of the newcomer's luggage looked to be full of gold, Hugh decided. The four-eyed man looked at his book.\n\n \"I would like to be directed to an hotel, place of repose, tavern, a\u00f1\"\n\n \"Yes, all right. Come on then,\" said Hugh hurriedly. He picked up one of the bundles and walked away quickly. The stranger, after a moment's hesitation, strolled after him.\n\n A train of thought shunted its way through Hugh's mind. Getting the newcomer to the Broken Drum so easily was a stroke of luck, no doubt of it, and Ymor would probably reward him. But for all his new acquaintance's mildness there was something about him that made Hugh uneasy, and for the life of him he couldn't figure out what it was. Not the two extra eyes, odd though they were. There was something else. He glanced back. The little man was ambling along in the middle of the street, looking around him with an expression of keen interest.\n\n Something else Hugh saw nearly made him gibber.\n\n The massive wooden chest, which he had last seen resting solidly on the quayside, was following on its master's heels with a gentle rocking gait. Slowly, in case a sudden movement on his part might break his fragile control over his own legs, Hugh bent slightly so that he could see under the chest.\n\n There were lots and lots of little legs. Very deliberately, Hugh turned around and walked very carefully towards the Broken Drum.\n", "characters": [{"name": "Rincewind", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Twoflower", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Bravd the Hublander", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "The Weasel", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Kerible the Enchanter", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Fredor", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Blind Hugh", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Cripple Wa", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Ymor", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "classic", "source": "validation"}}
{"story_id": "the_ships_of_merior_extract", "text": "On the morning the Fellowship sorcerer who had crowned the King at\n\nOstermere fared northward on the old disused road, the five years of peace\n\nprecariously re-established since the carnage that followed the Mist-\n\nwraith's defeat as yet showed no sign of breaking.\n\nThe moment seemed unlikely for happenstance to intrude and shape a\n\nspiralling succession of events to upend loyalties and kingdoms. Havish's\n\ncoastal landscape with its jagged, shady valleys wore the mottled greens\n\nof late spring. Dew still spangled the leaf-tips, touched brilliant by early\n\nsunlight. Asandir rode in his shirtsleeves, the dark, silver-banded mantle\n\nlately worn for the royal coronation folded inside his saddle pack. Hair\n\nof the same fine silver blew uncovered in the gusts that whipped off the\n\nsea; that tossed the clumped bracken on the hill crests and fanned gorse\n\nagainst lichened outcrops of quartz rock. The black stud who bore him\n\nstrode hock-deep in grass, alone beneath cloudless sky. Wildflowers\n\nthrashed by its passage sweetened the air with perfume and the jagging\n\nflight of disturbed bees.\n\nFor the first time in centuries of service, Asandir was solitary, and on\n\nan errand of no pressing urgency. The ruthless war, the upsets to rule\n\nand to trade that had savaged the north in the wake of the Mistwraith's\n\nimprisonment had settled, if not into the well-governed order secured for\n\nHavish, then at least into patterns that confined latent hatreds to the\n\navenues of statecraft and politics. Better than most, Asandir knew the\n\nrespite was fated not to last. His memories were bitter and hurtful, of\n\nthe great curse cast by the Mistwraith to set both its captors at odds; the\n\nland's restoration to clear sky bought at a cost of two mortal destinies\n\nand the land's lasting peace.\n\nUnless the Fellowship sorcerers could find means to break\n\nDesh-thiere's geas of hatred against the royal half-brothers whose gifts\n\nbrought its bane, the freed sunlight that warmed the growing eart\n\nyet be paid for in blood. With the restored throne of Havish firml'\n\nits crowned heir, Asandir at last rode to join his colleagues in thei\n\nto unbind the Mistwraith's two victims from the vicious throe\n\nvengeance.\n\nRelaxed in rare contentment, too recently delivered from cent~\n\nsunless damp to take the hale spring earth for granted, he let hi\n\nsoar with the winds. The road he had chosen was years overgrow:\n\nmore than a crease that meandered through thorn and brushb\n\nre-emerge where the growth was browsed close by deer. Desl:\n\nbanished mists, the townsmen still held uneasy fears of open spac~\n\nthe sites of forgotten mysteries. Northbound travellers innately p~\n\nto book their passage by ship.\n\nUntroubled by the after-presence of Paravian spirits, not at all di:\n\nby the foundations of ancient ruins that underlay the hammocks\n\nroses, the sorcerer rode with his reins looped. He followed the wa\n\nout misstep, guided by memories that predated the most we~\n\nbroken wall. His appearance of reverie was deceptive. At each n\n\nmage-heightened senses resonated with the natural energies tl~\n\nrounded him. The sun on his shoulders became a benedictio~\n\ncounterpoint and celebration to the ringing reverberation that w~\n\nstriking shadow off edges of wild stone.\n\nWhen a dissonance snagged in the weave, reflex and habit s\n\nAsandir's complaisance. His powers of perception tightened to tr\n\nimmediate cause.\n\nWhatever bad news approached from the south, his mount'\n\nsenses caught no sign. The stallion snorted, shook out his mane,\n\nAsandir rein him over to the verge of the trail. Long minutes\n\ndrum roll of galloping hooves startled the larks to songless flight\n\nthe messenger on his labouring mount hove into view, the sorc~\n\nhis saddle, frowning; while the stud, bored with waiting, cropper\n\nThe courier wore royal colours, the distinctive scarlet tabard a~\n\nhawk blazon of the king's personal service snapped into creases\n\nthe breeze. No common message bearer, he owned the carriage of -~\n\npion fighter. But the battle-brash courage that graced his reputati\n\nmissing as he hauled his horse to a prancing, head-shaking halt.\n\nThe man was a fool, who eagerly brought trouble to the ear of a i\n\nship sorcerer.\n\nBriskly annoyed, Asandir spoke before the king's rider could\n\nhis uncertainty. 'I know you were sent by your liege. If my spel\n\nDakar is cause and root of some problem, I say now, as I told his ~\n\nand the realm's steward on my departure: there is no possible di~\n\nthat might stem from an apprentice's misdeeds that your High\n\njustice cannot handle.'\n\nThe messenger nursed lathered reins to divert his eye-rolling\n\nfrom her sidewards crabsteps through the bracken. 'Begging pardon, Sor-\n\ncerer. But Dakar got himself drunk. There was a fight.' Sweating pale\n\nbefore Asandir's displeasure, he finished in a crisp rush. 'Your spell-\n\nbinder's got himself knifed and King Eldit's healers say he'll bleed to\n\ndeath.'\n\n'Oh, indeed?' The words bit the quiet like sheared metal. Asandir's\n\nbrows cocked up. Features laced over with creases showed a moment of\n\nfierce surprise. Then he started his black up from a mouthful of grass\n\nand spun him thundering back toward the city.\n\nAlone in the derelict roadway on a sidling, race-bred horse, the royal\n\ncourier had no mind to linger. He was not clan kindred, to feel at ease\n\nin the wild places where the old stones lay carved with uncanny patterns\n\nto snag and bewitch a man's thoughts. The instant his over-strung mare\n\nquit her tussle with the bit, he nursed her along at a trot, relieved to be\n\nspared the company of a sorcerer any right-thinking mortal knew better\n\nthan to presume not to fear.\n\n\n\nThe city known as the jewel of the southwest coast flung an ungainly\n\nsprawl of battlements across the crown of a cove. Built over warrens of\n\nlimestone caves once used as a smuggler's haven, the architecture\n\nreflected twelve centuries of changing tastes, battered as much by storms\n\nas by war, and bearing like layers in sediment the mismatched masonry of\n\nrefortifications and repairs. Sea trade provided the marrow of Ostermere's\n\nwealth. Walls of tawny brick abutted bulwarks of native limestone, scab-\n\nrous with moss and smothered in lee-facing crannies by salt-stunted run-\n\nners of wild ivy. The whole overlooked a series of weathered ledges that\n\ncommanded a west-facing inlet, each tier crusted with half-timber shops\n\nand slate-roofed mansions still gay with bunting and gold streamers from\n\ncelebration of the king's accession. If the merchant galleys docked along\n\nthe seaside gates no longer flew banners at their mastheads, if the guards\n\nby the harbourmaster's office had shed ceremonial accoutrements for\n\nboiled leather hauberks and plain steel, a charge of excitement yet\n\nlingered.\n\nIn all the realm, this city had been honoured as the royal seat until the\n\nwalls at Telmandir could be raised out of ruin and restored to the splen-\n\ndours of years past. An alertness like frost clung to the men hand-picked\n\nfor the royal guard. Out of pride for their youthful sovereign, they had\n\nthe unused north postern winched open and the shanty market that\n\nencroached upon its bailey cleared of beggars and squatters' stalls when\n\nAsandir's stallion clattered through.\n\nIn a courtyard still gloomy under overhanging tenements, the sorcerer\n\ndismounted. He tossed his reins to a barefoot boy groom grown familiar\n\nwith the stud through the months of change as town governance\n\nhad been replaced by sovereign monarchy. Without pause for greeting,\n\nAsandir strode off, scattering geese and a loose pig from the pud\n\nrun-off by the wash house. He dodged through men in sweaty tunics\n\nunloaded tuns from an ale dray, avoided a bucket-bearing scullion\n\ncrossed without mishap through the tumbling brown melee of a ~\n\nhound bitch's cavorting pups.\n\nJust arrived, all but brushed aside with the same brisk lack of cerem\n\nthe captain of Ostermere's garrison pumped on fat legs to join the\n\ncerer. A capricious gust snatched his unbelted surcoat. Clutching sc:\n\nbroadcloth with both hands to escape getting muffled by his clothin~\n\nrelayed facts with a directness at odds with his untidy turnout.\n\n'It was a damnfool accident, the Mad Prophet so drunken he c,\n\nbarely stand upright. He'd visited the kitchens to meet a maid he clai\n\nhe'd an assignation with. Muddled as he was, he kissed the wrong d\n\nHer husband came in at just the right time to lose his temper.'

It was not, and he knew it.\n\n\u2018You\u2019re looking well,\u2019 Jonathan Meridian said as she walked up to him. \u2018I was expecting something a little more battered, maybe.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah, well\u2026 Let\u2019s leave all that until we get home, huh? Then I don\u2019t have to do it twice.\u2019\n\nJonathan nodded. \u2018That is a good idea. That all the luggage you\u2019ve got?\u2019 He nodded toward the small bag she was carrying.\n\n\u2018Uh-huh. Fabricators are a wonderful invention and, to be honest, I don\u2019t have all that much suitable for Topeka weather.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s March. Almost temperate.\u2019\n\nFox looked up at the sun, high in the sky. \u2018Dad, it\u2019s pushing twenty, Celsius. New York is barely in double figures.\u2019\n\n\u2018Better get you out of the sun then, before you melt.\u2019\n\n\u2018Not much chance of that.\u2019 Which was very true given her current state, but she was saving all that for when she got home. \u2018Still, I want to get home and tell you both the news, and then I can get on with the resting part of this.\u2019\n\n\u2018We\u2019re both happy you wanted to take your medical leave here.\u2019 He took her bag from her and tossed it into the back of the sedan before opening the passenger door for her.\n\nGrinning at him, Fox waited until he got in the other side before saying, \u2018Have you been practising being a gentleman for all these political dinner parties I\u2019m sure you attend now?\u2019\n\n\u2018We don\u2019t. Many of them anyway. Uh\u2026 Your mother\u2026 has been upset since we heard what happened. She\u2019s going to be a bit emotional about this.\u2019\n\nThey did not know the half of it, but\u2026 \u2018I kind of figured she might be. How are you two doing? How\u2019s the Watch doing?\u2019\n\n\u2018Good, aside from worry, and rapidly improving.\u2019 Jonathan paused for a second, and then clearly decided that the Watch was a safe topic for now. \u2018I won\u2019t say the first few weeks weren\u2019t testing, but people are starting to trust that the Watch is going to be able to handle things when NAPA shuts down. There have been one or two reprimands, but mostly for failing to keep up with paperwork. No one\u2019s reported any problems with undue use of force or favouritism. I think things are working out pretty well.\u2019\n\n\u2018How about the investigations side of things?\u2019\n\n\u2018Nothing major\u2019s come up. A few robberies of one sort or another. We called in Ray Rogers just to support a percentage of the investigations really. He\u2019s happy with the way the Watch officers are handling minor stuff like that and those support vests are working perfectly.\u2019\n\n\u2018Good,\u2019 Fox said. \u2018I\u2019m supposed to be out here taking it easy. I\u2019d hate to have to kick anyone\u2019s butt.\u2019\n\n\u2018No butt-kicking required. Don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019\n\nFox looked out the window as the sedan hurried north into the city. Thinking about it, kicking someone\u2019s behind might have done her some good. \u2018I won\u2019t.\u2019 There were plenty of other things to worry about\u2026\n\n~~\n\nAndrea Meridian started crying as soon as Fox stepped out of the car, bolted forward, and wrapped her arms around her daughter\u2019s neck. There was mumbling and wailing which Fox was fairly sure was in no language previously heard on Earth: words were certainly hard to make out anyway.\n\n\u2018Mom\u2026 Mom\u2026 Mom, do you think we could maybe take this inside before my shirt dissolves?\u2019\n\nAndrea let go, backed up, and punched Fox in the shoulder. \u2018I have a right to be upset after what happened to you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, yes, but don\u2019t you want to save some for when you\u2019ve heard the full story?\u2019\n\n\u2018I thought we had\u2026\u2019\n\n\u2018Clearly not, Andrea,\u2019 Jonathan said, walking around the car. \u2018I need to take this back in a bit, but I\u2019d like to find out what we weren\u2019t told before that.\u2019\n\nFox nodded. \u2018You could start by telling me what you were told so I don\u2019t have to go over it all again.\u2019\n\n\u2018Ray Rogers came over to tell us you\u2019d been kidnapped,\u2019 Andrea said as they migrated toward the house. \u2018I was worried, very worried, but he said that Palladium was putting every resource into finding you.\u2019\n\n\u2018He didn\u2019t hold back,\u2019 Jonathan added. \u2018He told us it was that Grant guy, or they thought it was. There was going to be a time limit on finding you alive, but that it was likely as much down to how long you could keep going and we knew you were strong.\u2019 He paused. \u2018Kitchen or lounge?\u2019\n\n\u2018Lounge,\u2019 Fox said.\n\n\u2018Coffee? Something stronger?\u2019\n\n\u2018Not right now. So I assume they told you they\u2019d found me?\u2019\n\n\u2018Kit was keeping us up to date from New York. Mostly it was \u201cno news right now, sorry,\u201d but then she dropped us a message saying she\u2019d located your general area, and then it was \u201cwe found her!\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018And then Jackson Martins called from Japan!\u2019 Andrea said, sounding as though this was tantamount to a personal message from God. \u2018He\u2026 didn\u2019t hold back either. He told us you were in bad shape, but he assured us he would make sure you came out of it okay.\u2019\n\n\u2018Called us again from New York,\u2019 Jonathan said. He pointed at the chair he usually used, indicating that Fox should sit there, and then took the sofa beside Andrea. \u2018He said you were getting worse, but he was taking you up to some research station on the Moon because it had the latest equipment. That man really thinks the world of you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah, well\u2026\u2019 Fox sat down. It felt kind of like the hot seat of an interrogation, but\u2026 \u2018I saved Terri, twice. I think he overcompensates, but he doesn\u2019t.\u2019\n\n\u2018I can see his point. We got a list of injuries. We assumed there was going to be some cybernetics involved. How much did they have to replace?\u2019\n\nFox forced a smile. \u2018Okay. They told you about the coma?\u2019 There was nodding. \u2018I developed a brain haemorrhage, and there was damage to my brain stem along with the severed spinal cord further down. Grant also used an experimental nanodrug on me to accelerate my healing while he was\u2026 Well, he used it too much and it trashed my natural ability to heal. So, I was crippled below the waist, my body was basically operating only because they patched me into a life support system, I wouldn\u2019t wake up, and my body wasn\u2019t actually healing.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh,\u2019 Andrea said, eyes wide.\n\n\u2018Yeah. Jackson took me up to Jenner. Uh, that\u2019s our research station in the Jenner Crater, on the far side. It\u2019s where we do our really secret research. Terri was already up there working on something I can\u2019t tell you about, and Jackson discussed some options with her.\u2019\n\n\u2018I understood Teresa Martins was an AI specialist,\u2019 Jonathan said, frowning.\n\n\u2018She is, mostly, but she has some fairly novel software projects aside from her normal AI stuff and Jackson wanted her to consider one of them.\u2019\n\n\u2018A software project?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah. Well, software, nanotechnology\u2026 Terri did the operating software for the Yliaster system, which is all nanomachines. But\u2026 Look, they had a few options, but none of them were exactly safe. The brain damage was pretty severe and the cybernetic technicians were pretty unsure about some sort of spinal implant working. They\u2019re working on a medical application of Yliaster which could have done the repairs, possibly, but they\u2019re nowhere near ready to try it on a living human. They considered freezing me until they could have it ready, but cryogenic technology isn\u2019t exactly a sure thing yet\u2026\u2019\n\n\u2018But you\u2019re here,\u2019 Andrea said. \u2018You look\u2026 like nothing happened to you. Just the same as you did. They must have done something.\u2019\n\nFox looked down at her hands. \u2018It\u2019s called Project Akh. Using ultra-high-definition MRI and nanomachines, they map out every neuron, every connection in someone\u2019s brain. Then they compile all that data into a database and Terri\u2019s written software which can\u2026 execute that database to create an emulation of the original brain. It\u2019s digitising a human, turning them into an infomorph. Uh\u2026 It\u2019s a destructive process. I can\u2019t go back. Even if my body was much use in its current state, it doesn\u2019t have a brain for me to inhabit.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh my God!\u2019\n\nNot looking up, Fox continued. \u2018Jackson felt they had no choice. All the other options were bad. The process is experimental. I\u2019m the first person to go through it, but they were sure it would work. It\u2019s just that all the test animals they tried it on, except one, couldn\u2019t cope outside a virtual environment. Terri was sure a human had the mental capacity to handle it and\u2026 Well, apparently I do, but\u2026\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh my God,\u2019 Andrea repeated and Fox looked up, dreading what she would see. Andrea looked horrified, her hands held up in front of her mouth in anguish. Fox\u2019s heart sank, metaphorically speaking since she no longer had one.\n\n\u2018So\u2026\u2019 Jonathan began. \u2018What we\u2019re looking at is some sort of android body?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah,\u2019 Fox replied. \u2018Computer in the chest to run the emulation software.\u2019\n\n\u2018My God, but they\u2019ve come a long way on realistic skin. I\u2019ve seen some of them in town and you can always tell. I mean\u2026 you\u2019re my daughter and I couldn\u2019t.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, it\u2019s\u2013\u2019\n\nAndrea was suddenly leaping across the space to wrap her arms around Fox\u2019s neck again. \u2018Oh, my poor baby! What you must\u2019ve been through!\u2019\n\n\u2018Uh\u2026\u2019\n\n\u2018Let the girl breathe, Andrea,\u2019 Jackson said.\n\n\u2018She\u2019s in a gynoid body,\u2019 Andrea replied, still holding on. \u2018She doesn\u2019t have to. And it\u2019s gynoid, not android. There\u2019s a difference.\u2019\n\n\u2018Technically true,\u2019 Fox said, \u2018but it\u2019s difficult to talk like this.\u2019\n\n\u2018You\u2019re doing fine. I can\u2019t imagine what it must be like. The first you knew of it was when you woke up? When they\u2026 started you up?\u2019\n\n\u2018Pretty much, yeah. I went to sleep in a hospital room in Tokyo and woke up in what turned out to be a simulation of my apartment, apparently all fixed. I was\u2026 a little unreasonable about it.\u2019\n\n\u2018Understandable,\u2019 Jonathan said. \u2018Still having some doubts?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes.\u2019\n\n\u2018Also understandable, but I couldn\u2019t tell. It\u2019s not just the body, the very lifelike gynoid body. You move the same, sound the same, act the same\u2026\u2019\n\nAndrea finally let go and returned to the sofa. \u2018You are the same.\u2019\n\n\u2018Sam said the same thing,\u2019 Fox said. \u2018Though Sam noticed that I\u2019m more flexible than I used to be, but he notices things like that. Kit keeps telling me she can\u2019t detect a difference aside from the fact that I keep worrying over it. Jackson and Terri treat me just like they did except for the technical aspects. Marie\u2026 She was kind of avoiding me, which is one of the reasons I came out here.\u2019\n\n\u2018We\u2019re not complaining,\u2019 Jonathan said. \u2018Marie will come around. She\u2019s young, probably unsettled by this. She\u2019ll handle it once she\u2019s had a chance to think it over.\u2019\n\n\u2018I guess I didn\u2019t give her much chance. You two are really okay with this?\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019d prefer it hadn\u2019t been needed, but I don\u2019t care what kind of body you\u2019re in so long as it\u2019s you that\u2019s in there.\u2019\n\n\u2018Agreed,\u2019 Andrea said, \u2018but they did do a remarkable job of replicating the original you. It does help, I suppose.\u2019\n\n\u2018Huh,\u2019 Fox said. \u2018Well, I sleep in a server while this thing recharges. Did they deliver it?\u2019\n\n\u2018Several MarTech technicians turned up to install a server of some sort in your room,\u2019 Jackson said. \u2018I\u2019m glad we\u2019d finished redecorating.\u2019\n\n\u2018That gets to stay here in case of visits. All I need to handle daily life. Uh, I don\u2019t really need to drink and I can get by on very minimal food, but I can eat and drink normally if I want. It\u2019s just\u2026 a bit wasteful.\u2019\n\n\u2018And you can\u2019t get drunk.\u2019\n\n\u2018No, sadly, I can\u2019t.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll get drunker for you,\u2019 Andrea said.\n\n\u2018But more importantly,\u2019 Jonathan went on, \u2018how secret is this?\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not. I\u2019m the poster child for Project Akh. It\u2019ll be public knowledge soon enough. On the other hand, we\u2019re not making a lot of noise about it yet. Uh, that\u2019s partially because I don\u2019t want to. I need to get used to it. It\u2019s kind of weird. Most of the time, I feel like me. Sometimes I don\u2019t.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019d imagine that\u2019s natural. Hell, I\u2019m still not quite used to this implant. I feel like a computer sometimes. It just pops things up for me when I think about them too loud.\u2019\n\nFox grinned, this time more genuinely. \u2018Finally went ahead with it then?\u2019\n\n\u2018And no matter what he says,\u2019 Andrea said, \u2018he wonders how he did without it.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yes, yes,\u2019 Jonathan said, \u2018I should\u2019ve done it years ago, but my point is that it took some getting used to. Change does. Where is Kit anyway? You mentioned her and she hasn\u2019t popped up to say hello.\u2019\n\nFox tapped her chest. \u2018She\u2019s in here. This thing has a fairly powerful computer so we can both run quite comfortably on it. I asked her to let me do this on my own. Uh\u2026 I think I was expecting more\u2026 of a reaction.\u2019\n\nKit\u2019s avatar, all large green eyes and foxy white tail, appeared beside Fox\u2019s chair. \u2018Good afternoon, Mister and Mrs Meridian. I told her you would understand, but she\u2019s convinced people should treat her differently.\u2019\n\n\u2018Afternoon, Kit,\u2019 Jonathan said, smiling. \u2018Well, she\u2019s right, but it\u2019ll be people who don\u2019t know her. And it won\u2019t all be \u201cbad,\u201d though I doubt Fox will see it as good attention.\u2019\n\n\u2018The Church,\u2019 Andrea said, nodding. \u2018I mean, I can\u2019t imagine many of the conventional religions taking this well, but the Church of God\u2019s Mind is going to think you\u2019re some sort of goddess, Tara.\u2019\n\nFox sagged in her seat. \u2018No one is to tell Danny Berkewitz about this. No one. Under any circumstances.\u2019\n\nAndrea developed what could only be described as a politician\u2019s smirk. \u2018What\u2019s it worth?\u2019\n\n~~\n\n\u2018So your mother got another social out of you?\u2019 Bart Wade said, smirking.\n\n\u2018Blackmailed another social out of me,\u2019 Fox replied. She was at the kitchen table, watching Bart and her parents eat. She was drinking wine, to be sociable, but she really did think wasting food on her was just about a crime.\n\nBartholomew Wade was the only other person in Topeka that Fox absolutely had to have in the know regarding her new condition. Even if she had expected more problems with her parents, especially her mother, she had known that Bart would take it in his usual, practical manner, and probably tell her that she was being an idiot. Bart was old, but only physically. His hair was grey, and increasing amounts of his body had been replaced with metal and plastic, but he had had a computer implanted long before Jonathan and his mind was as sharp as ever.\n\n\u2018Blackmail,\u2019 Andrea said, \u2018is such an ugly word. I prefer \u201cpersuasion with menaces.\u201d\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s better,\u2019 Fox countered, \u2018but the point is that I wanted you to know I\u2019d beaten you hands down on the cybernetics, Bart, before Friday. That way I don\u2019t have to explain in front of everyone.\u2019\n\nBart gave a shrug. \u2018I still hold the Tin Man title for the street. You\u2019re just a visitor, so I can live with it.\u2019\n\n\u2018I figured you would. Though I recall you saying how big a can of worms this kind of technology was back in January.\u2019\n\n\u2018Sure is. When the news breaks, you\u2019re going to be up to your neck in political and religious types. You\u2019ll have the Church of God\u2019s Mind demanding that the government legalise it, and they won\u2019t be alone. And you\u2019ll have the religious Right demanding it be outlawed.\u2019\n\n\u2018And probably that I get turned off. Yeah, I know.\u2019\n\n\u2018But you have that covered, right?\u2019 Andrea said. \u2018You said MarTech had come to some special arrangement for their first subject.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m covered,\u2019 Fox agreed. \u2018I\u2019m legally the same person. Huh, if the worst ever came to the worst, I could emigrate to Luna City. They have a pretty solid equal rights thing going up there. That\u2019s why the American government agreed to hold my testing there before I was allowed down here.\u2019 She rolled her eyes. \u2018That was annoying and pointless.\u2019\n\n\u2018They were trying to make sure you were you?\u2019 Bart asked.\n\n\u2018Well, yeah, but it was an IQ test followed by some guy asking me questions I could\u2019ve probably answered with an internet search. Seriously, mother\u2019s maiden name. Name of my first school.\u2019\n\n\u2018You remembered my maiden name?\u2019 Andrea asked.\n\n\u2018Barlow. I do actually remember my grandparents, Mom. It was kind of slipshod, but I guess I shouldn\u2019t complain. NAPA sent someone up to interview me too. That was more detailed, but mostly on what happened with Grant and Hannah.\u2019\n\n\u2018Kit got on the news about that Hannah girl. An AI giving evidence at a hearing and your testimony. You really don\u2019t hold a grudge over her part in this?\u2019\n\n\u2018I do,\u2019 Kit said from her position behind Fox, perched on one of the work surfaces. \u2018Equally, she helped rescue Fox. I am conflicted on the matter.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2026\u2019 Fox frowned. \u2018I guess I\u2019m conflicted too. I\u2019ve got some pretty obvious issues with her, but she was almost as much a victim as me and I think she deserves to be tried for what she did, not just turned off and scrapped.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well,\u2019 Bart said, \u2018you set the cat among the pigeons with that one. They\u2019re still trying to decide what to do about it. Might go all the way to the top.\u2019\n\n\u2018I haven\u2019t been paying a lot of attention to the news recently. Jenner\u2019s pretty isolated and I\u2019ve been avoiding anything controversial since I got back. I\u2019ve got enough controversy of my own.\u2019\n\n\u2018Fair point. You won\u2019t have seen that the Japanese have stolen MarTech\u2019s thunder then?\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh?\u2019\n\n\u2018Some company over there has made the first artificial biological human. Well, not human, obviously, but you know what I mean. Bioroid, they call them.\u2019\n\n\u2018BioTek were working on it. Are working on it. They needed a variant of Yliaster to make it viable. So they can build an entire adult body instead of growing a cell up to adult size the normal way. An eighteen-year production cycle wasn\u2019t viewed as ideal.\u2019\n\n\u2018Huh, no, I\u2019d imagine not. Apparently someone in Japan has cracked it. Of course, it\u2019s for sex. If they don\u2019t actually invent something specifically for sex, someone\u2019ll find a way to use it for that pretty quickly.\u2019\n\nAndrea giggled. \u2018So true. It seems a shame that the first artificial life we make is for that though.\u2019\n\n\u2018Alternative is probably some sort of manual labour. Slave labour. Not good either, but I\u2019m bringing the mood down.\u2019 Bart flashed a grin at Andrea. \u2018Nice outfit you\u2019re almost wearing, Andy. I see the sparkle hasn\u2019t gone from your renewed love life.\u2019\n\nAndrea blushed, but just a little. Her cropped camisole top and shorts were fairly brief. \u2018Jonathan likes it. And so do you, you old letch.\u2019\n\n\u2018Not denyin\u2019 it. Mind you, you\u2019ve got competition. Your daughter\u2019s not exactly covering herself up and she\u2019s got more to show.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh\u2026 Don\u2019t remind me. I\u2019ve always been a little envious.\u2019\n\n\u2018And,\u2019 Fox said, smirking, \u2018now there\u2019s no danger of sag. Ever.\u2019\n\nAndrea mock scowled at her daughter. \u2018You\u2019re not too old to spank, young lady.\u2019\n\n~~\n\nFox\u2019s old bedroom had been redecorated. Gone were the trappings of a late-teen, replaced with a not-too-modern but certainly updated look in earth tones, which included a double bed that had a rather nice bronze-coloured, embroidered comforter over it. It had been done in the hope that Fox would visit with Jason Deveraux, her boyfriend.\n\n\u2018We kind of planned to come over before he started his new job,\u2019 Fox said. Her mother was seeing her to bed before joining Jonathan. Andrea was being a little more solicitous than usual, likely still worrying over Fox\u2019s recovery. \u2018Then I went and got myself kidnapped\u2026\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see him again, Tara,\u2019 Andrea said. \u2018I\u2019m sure that bed will see some use at some point.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, it\u2019s going to see some now.\u2019 Fox looked at the black box sitting beside the bed, already hooked up to the mains. There were indicator lights on it, showing that it was functional. A small camera mounted on the top was unmoving and there were a couple of cables coiled beside it. \u2018I only need four hours\u2019 sleep now, and this thing will be charged before I wake up, but I might still be in there if you come in in the morning.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll let you come down on your own. Take your time. You are supposed to be resting.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah. Look, do you mind if I do this on my own? It\u2019s still a little\u2026\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019ll leave you to it. I\u2019d imagine you can contact our implants if you need anything anyway.\u2019\n\nFox waited for her mother to leave before undressing. Nudity was technically unnecessary, but she had slept naked for a long time and it made things a little easier. She pulled the comforter back on the bed and then picked up the thickest of the two cables. It ended in something that looked like one of those nerve-induction exercise devices people had thought were the answer to exercise without effort decades ago: a cloth belt with a pair of plastic pads attached to it. Strapping the belt around her hips, she made sure the two pads were roughly over her hip joints and closed the fastening.\n\nNext came the second cable, much thinner with a small plug at the end. Reaching behind her neck, she felt under her hair for the small socket hidden away there and pushed the plug in. Almost immediately, a connection notification came through, followed by an authentication exchange panel.\n\n\u2018All set up for us,\u2019 Kit commented. \u2018Jackson is really going out of his way to make sure this works for you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah, well\u2026 He would. He always does.\u2019 Fox started her transfer to the server and climbed into bed, pulling the covers over her. \u2018I assume you\u2019re coming over with me.\u2019\n\n\u2018Of course. I\u2019ve some work to do, and you\u2019ll want someone to talk to when you wake up hours before your parents.\u2019\n\n\u2018You know, not being able to sleep in is a major fault in this design. Turn off, \u201csleep\u201d for want of a better word, and four hours later I wake up. Ding! Awake.\u2019 Fox closed her eyes and watched the progress bar on her ba transfer. \u2018And they need to give me a faster cable interface. I mean, Terri was talking about using wireless transfers sometimes, but that would take ages.\u2019\n\n\u2018I know. That\u2019s how I usually travel.\u2019\n\n\u2018You\u2019re used to it. This is all new to me. It\u2019s so slow\u2026\u2019\n\n\u2018You could be in Japan in five minutes, ten at the most. You could be on Mars in a day or so instead of weeks.\u2019\n\n\u2018I suppose that has some utility. If I\u2019ve got a frame to load into once I get there anyway. Does Palladium have contracts on Mars?\u2019\n\n\u2018There are MarTech facilities on Mars and Venus, as well as the lunar sites, of course. Setting up a body for you on the Moon would be very easy. You need never ride in a rocket ever again.\u2019\n\n\u2018Huh. Now I see why Jackson wants to do this.\u2019\n\n\u2018Hmm, yes. He does suffer terribly from space sickness.\u2019\n\nFox smirked. \u2018I don\u2019t think that quite covers the depths of his misery. He is a little better when he can have some gravity, but then the Coriolis effect tends to kick in with spin gravity\u2026 Yeah, he\u2019d love just being able to radio himself over to Jenner. Transfer\u2019s almost complete. I\u2019ve programmed it to shunt me straight into sleep mode on the other side so\u2026 Night, Kit.\u2019\n\n\u2018Goodnight, Fox. Sleep well.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, like I have a choice\u2026\u2019\n\n28th March.\n\nPossibly one of the most important advances in biotechnology this century, the new Japanese bioroid carried the name Yurei no Ningyo, which seemed to be being translated as Ghost Doll. Fox discovered the reason for the name when she located a video of the launch conference from the Aphrodite Cybernetics facility in the Chiba Industrial Zone.\n\nAphrodite Cybernetics built androids and gynoids more or less exclusively for the pleasure market. They did not come immediately to mind on the list of people who might scoop BioTek to the first artificial humanoid, but they did tinker with biotechnology: their high-end models used cloned skin to give a more realistic look to their robots. This made it strange that the Ghost Doll bioroids did not appear especially realistic. They had pale, almost white, skin with the texture of latex, very red pouting lips, and eyes that always seemed to be opened wide. They were walking rubber sex dolls and Fox found herself wondering what kind of mind came up with something like that.\n\n\u2018I would suggest it was a male one,\u2019 Kit said when Fox commented on the video. \u2018Possibly one born last century. Perhaps the company was unable to create a working model with more natural skin, though it seems more like a specific choice.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah. If I discover BioTek are doing anything like this, I\u2019ll\u2026 get very angry about it.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m nothing but software, and I find it rather offensive. Perhaps it will fail to sell.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh\u2026 Don\u2019t count on it. Aside from anything else, they\u2019re selling it as a luxury item. People with more money than sense are going to jump right in. I\u2019d suggest that the Japanese market might be more amenable, but I bet you there are Americans trying to sniff out a way to import one right now. The interesting thing will be to see whether they create a male version.\u2019\n\n\u2018The market for pleasure androids still lags behind the gynoid market, though it is not far from parity. Have you ever tried one?\u2019\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 Fox said. \u2018Thought about it. There\u2019s something to be said for a boyfriend you can stuff in a closet when you\u2019re bored with him. Of course, now I\u2019m a gynoid girlfriend.\u2019\n\n\u2018You know, I don\u2019t think Jason will think of it that way. I also think that Jackson would not have been unhappy if you had stopped off at Prokhorov Station on the way to Earth.\u2019\n\n\u2018Maybe I didn\u2019t want to test Jason\u2019s reaction just then because I felt insecure. I\u2019m still finding myself, Kit. If, and I\u2019m not saying he would have, but if Jason reacted badly\u2026 Not sure I could take that right now.\u2019 Fox checked the time. \u2018Almost six. I\u2019m getting up. Mom and Dad will think I\u2019ve been replaced by a duplicate, but\u2026 I have, so it seems fair.\u2019\n\n~~\n\nIt was a bit after six a.m. when Jonathan and Andrea came down to find Fox sitting at the kitchen table, eating something from a plastic tub which appeared to be Greek yoghurt. The smell of coffee pervaded the room as well.\n\n\u2018Now I am starting to worry about you,\u2019 Andrea said. \u2018Up before us and eating yoghurt?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah, well, this way I don\u2019t walk in on you two kissing like teenagers at a drive-in, and it\u2019s not yoghurt.\u2019\n\nFrowning, Andrea walked over to the table and started reaching a finger toward the tub. \u2018It looks like\u2013\u2019\n\n\u2018Uh\u2026 Don\u2019t. Seriously. It\u2019s specifically for my skin. It\u2019s basically protein and nanomachines.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s poisonous to humans?\u2019\n\n\u2018Huh, no. It just tastes absolutely disgusting and it won\u2019t do you any good at all. It\u2019s indigestible and gross, but it\u2019s got everything I need for a glossy coat and wet nose. And I turn off my sense of taste before eating it.\u2019\n\n\u2018You can do that?\u2019\n\n\u2018Smell, taste, and touch, if I want. The smell thing is going to come in useful at murder scenes.\u2019\n\nKit appeared beside the table nodding. \u2018She is not joking about that last part. Not even a little. You know you don\u2019t need to eat that so often?\u2019\n\nFox gave a shrug. \u2018I\u2019m still getting used to what I need. I\u2019d rather have too much stored up than not enough.\u2019\n\n\u2018And I guess coffee is just a drink now,\u2019 Jonathan said. \u2018And you can\u2019t get drunk.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, I still like coffee and the taste of alcoholic drinks.\u2019\n\n\u2018And she can get drunk,\u2019 Kit added. \u2018Oh\u2026 She can get really drunk. It just takes virtual alcohol to do it. You should have seen her when\u2013\u2019\n\n\u2018And we are not discussing my drunken episodes on Jenner with my parents.\u2019\n\n\u2018But it\u2019s funny!\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s not funny, it\u2019s embarrassing. Don\u2019t think I won\u2019t virtually spank you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, yes please, mistress!\u2019\n\nFox winced: she had been asking for that. Jonathan burst out laughing. Andrea put her hand over her mouth, eyes wide, and said, \u2018Kit!\u2019 The shocked look was somewhat diminished by the fact that she appeared to be trying not to giggle.\n\n\u2018You\u2019d better not be teaching Belle this sass,\u2019 Fox said.\n\n\u2018Belle prefers quiet dignity,\u2019 Kit replied, \u2018though I think she\u2019s getting there.\u2019 Then she pouted. \u2018You can\u2019t be mad at me. I\u2019m paru-kawaii, remember?\u2019\n\n\u2018I can well believe it,\u2019 Jonathan said, \u2018but what does it mean?\u2019\n\n\u2018Very cute,\u2019 Fox said, \u2018in Japanese. Kit\u2019s all famous over there. She gets fan mail and mentions on social media sites, and I heard she was doing the chat show circuit\u2026\u2019\n\n\u2018What?!\u2019 Kit squeaked. \u2018No! No one said anything about\u2013 Oh, you\u2019re making fun of me.\u2019\n\nFox smiled and got up to get coffee. \u2018The look on your face\u2026\u2019\n\n~~\n\nFox pulled her Q-bug up outside an old industrial building and stepped off, adjusting her cami-top absently before heading for the door. There was little to indicate that this was the Topeka office of Palladium Security Solutions, just a small sign beside the door. However, the fact that the door recognised her ID and opened as she walked up to it did make Fox feel like she still belonged.\n\n\u2018I thought you were supposed to be on medical leave,\u2019 Ray Rogers said as Fox walked into the office the investigators shared.\n\nFox raised an eyebrow. \u2018If I was working, I wouldn\u2019t be here in a tiny little top and denim shorts.\u2019\n\n\u2018First time I saw you, you were wearing a top like that. I admit, there was less leg on show.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well, I\u2019m not working. I figured that, since I was in town anyway, I\u2019d come over and see if everyone was settling in okay. Not that you need to settle\u2026 And to thank you for sending over my gear and the Q-bug.\u2019\n\nRogers nodded. \u2018New housing\u2019s finished. We\u2019re in and it\u2019s all functioning, including the new fabricator. Not much happening, but the Watch has been using us for oversight on a few small cases. It\u2019s all pretty much making sure they\u2019re handling things properly. Uh, they have been.\u2019\n\n\u2018Great.\u2019 Fox grabbed a seat beside Rogers\u2019s desk and sat down. \u2018So how are things with Ray Rogers?\u2019\n\n\u2018Oh, uh\u2026 Well, pretty good\u2026 I\u2019ve been, uh, dating\u2026\u2019 There were some snickers from the other people in the office and Rogers flashed a glare around his colleagues.\n\n\u2018Anyone I know?\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah\u2026 It\u2019s Crystal Bateson.\u2019 Rogers frowned. \u2018You don\u2019t look very surprised.\u2019\n\n\u2018She asked whether you were single last time I was down here. I\u2019m more surprised that she actually went for it than that you\u2019re dating her. She\u2019s an attractive woman. What does Sandy think?\u2019\n\n\u2018That it\u2019s great, as far as I can tell. Uh, the age difference is\u2013\u2019\n\n\u2018Meaningless these days. Unless you\u2019re into the whole \u201ctoy boy\u201d thing, of course.\u2019 Fox watched Rogers\u2019s cheeks colour and grinned. \u2018I\u2019m happy for you. Both of you. She needs something good in her life. Of course, if you break her heart, I\u2019ll help Sandy skin you.\u2019\n\n\u2018Huh. If I do that, I\u2019ll hold the knives while you\u2019re doing it. Uh\u2026 We got reports through. About your condition, I mean. You\u2019re looking pretty good, but\u2026 We were worried about you. Helen and Kit are handling the top-end admin pretty well, no complaints at all, but do you know when you\u2019ll be back on the job?\u2019\n\nFox leaned back in her chair. \u2018No\u2026 I have a few things to work through. It\u2019s been a tough month.\u2019\n\n\u2018Yeah, I can imagine.\u2019\n\n~~\n\nThe problem, of course, was that no one could really imagine what Fox was trying to work through. No one with fewer than four legs had ever had to do it before, and Fox was fairly sure that Agnus the digital rat was not going to be much help; the language barrier alone was more or less insurmountable.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t believe talking to Agnus would help anyway,\u2019 Kit said as they drove back to Fox\u2019s parents\u2019 house. \u2018I don\u2019t believe that her experience really impinges on the problem.\u2019\n\n\u2018Eyes on the road,\u2019 Fox responded. Kit was driving the bug by remote because she did not get the chance that often.\n\n\u2018I am quite capable of holding a conversation while driving. Don\u2019t change the subject.\u2019\n\n\u2018Since I gave you your command keys, you\u2019ve got bossy.\u2019 There was silence for a second or two and then Fox filled it. \u2018Okay, why doesn\u2019t Agnus\u2019s experience have a bearing on mine?\u2019\n\n\u2018Because Agnus was happy being a rat and got on with doing just that. You, however, are not happy getting on with being what you are.\u2019\n\n\u2018Human?\u2019\n\n\u2018A detective. You\u2019re quite fit to resume work. You usually work to avoid personal issues, but now you\u2019re using a personal issue to avoid work.\u2019\n\n\u2018I\u2019m n\u2013 Okay, I am. This job cost me\u2026 almost everything, Kit. I\u2019m not me any more. I mean, I guess I am, but my real body is in a freezer on the Moon. And that\u2019s only because Terri still entertains the hope that they can fix it up and build me a new brain. I don\u2019t know whether I can do this any more.\u2019\n\n\u2018I believe you can, and you will. I accept that it may take some time for you to realise that, however. Also, I am pleased to note that you do not seem concerned that you are not yourself. You appear to have accepted that your mind is what makes you Fox Meridian.\u2019\n\n\u2018People keep telling me I act the same, I still remember all the embarrassing things I\u2019d rather have forgotten when I was sixteen, and I\u2019ve never been much into metaphysics. I can do without existential dilemmas, so unless something comes up to suggest there\u2019s something missing, I am me. I think I am Fox Meridian, therefore I am. Or something. Hell, the real Fox Meridian isn\u2019t going to tell me I\u2019m not. She doesn\u2019t have a brain.\u2019\n\n\u2018Somehow,\u2019 Kit said, \u2018I think that I was happier before you explained your reasoning, but it\u2019s a good start. Have you given any thought to what you would do if you cannot continue your current job?\u2019\n\n\u2018Of course not. I\u2019m too busy panicking about not being able to do it. Maybe I should take up farming. Dad seems to like it.\u2019\n\nThere was amusement in Kit\u2019s voice when she replied. \u2018Somehow, I cannot picture you as a farmer, Fox.\u2019\n\n\u2018Well\u2026 I could be\u2026\u2019\n", "characters": [{"name": "Fox Meridian", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Jonathan Meridian", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Andrea Meridian", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Kit", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Ray Rogers", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Jackson Martins", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Teresa Martins", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Grant", "role": "ANTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Hannah", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Bart Wade", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Danny Berkewitz", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Jason Deveraux", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Sam", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Marie", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Belle", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Crystal Bateson", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Sandy", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Helen", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "classic", "source": "validation"}}
{"story_id": "a_memory_called_empire_extract", "text": "And from behind the curve of the large gaseous planet at coordinate B5682.76R1, the Emperor Twelve Solar-Flare arose on the bow of her ship, and she was a radiant blaze flooding all of the void. The rays of her light, reaching outward like the spear-spokes of her throne, struck the metal shells which were the dwelling-places of human beings in Sector B5682, and illuminated them brightly. The sensors of Twelve Solar-Flare\u2019s ship recorded ten of them, each alike to the other, and this number has not increased since. Within the shells the men and women knew not seasons nor growth nor decay, but lived endlessly in orbit without benefit of a planetary home. The largest of these shells called itself Lsel Station, which in the language of its people meant a station that both listened and heard. But the people there had grown strange, and cleaved to themselves, though they were capable of learning language, and immediately began to do so \u2026\n\n\u2014The Expansion History, Book V, lines 72\u201387, anonymous but attributed to the historian-poet Pseudo-Thirteen River, writing in the reign of the Emperor of All Teixcalaan Three Perigee\n\n\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nIn order to expedite your travel into the Imperium, Teixcalaan requests the following as proofs of identity: a) a genetic record stating your sole possession of your own genotype, unshared with clonesibs OR a notarized document stating that your genotype is at least 90 percent unique and that no other individual holds LEGAL claim to it; b) an itemized list of goods, chattels, currencies, and objects of idea commerce which you intend to bring with you; c) a work permit from a registered employer in a Teixcalaanli system, signed and notarized, with salary and maintenance information, OR a record of superlative performance on the Teixcalaanli Imperial Examinations OR an invitation by a person, governmental entity, bureau, ministry, or other authorized individual specifying your entrance and exit dates from Imperium space OR evidence of sufficient self-supporting currency \u2026\n\n\u2014Form 721Q, Visa Application Made from Foreign Sectors ALPHABETIC LANGUAGE VARIANT, page 6\n\n\n\n\nMAHIT came down to the City, heart-planet and capital of the Teixcalaanli Empire, in a seed-skiff, a bubble of a ship hardly big enough for her body and her luggage both. She squirted from the side of the imperial cruiser Ascension\u2019s Red Harvest and burned atmosphere on her planetward trajectory, which distorted the view. Thus the first time she saw the City with her own flesh eyes, not in infofiche or holograph or imago-memory, it was haloed in white fire and shone like an endless glittering sea: an entire planet rendered into an ecumenopolis, palatially urban. Even its dark spots\u2014older metropolises not yet clad in metal, decaying urban blight, the harnessed remains of lakes\u2014looked populated. Only the oceans remained untouched, and they gleamed too, a brilliantine blue-turquoise.\n\nThe City was very beautiful and very big. Mahit had been on a fair number of planets, the ones closest to Lsel Station that weren\u2019t completely inimical to human life, and she was nevertheless overcome by awe. Her heart beat faster; her palms went clammy where they gripped her harness. The City appeared exactly as it was always described in Teixcalaanli documents and songs: the jewel at the heart of the Empire. Complete with atmospheric glow.\n\n<That\u2019s what looking at it is meant to make you think,> said her imago. He was a faint staticky taste on the back of her tongue, a flash of grey eyes and sun-dark skin in her peripheral vision. The voice in the back of her head, but not quite her voice: someone around her age, but male, and quicksilver-smug, and as excited to be here as she was. She felt her mouth curve in his smile, a heavier and wider thing than the muscles in her face preferred. They were new to each other. His expressions were very strong.\n\nGet out of my nervous system, Yskandr, she thought at him, gently chiding. An imago\u2014the implanted, integrated memory of one\u2019s predecessor, housed half in her neurology and half in a small ceramic-and-metal machine clasped to her brainstem\u2014wasn\u2019t supposed to take over the host\u2019s nervous system unless the host consented. At the beginning of the partnership, though, consent was complicated. The version of Yskandr inside her mind remembered having a body, and sometimes he used Mahit\u2019s as if it were his own. She worried about it. There was still so much space between them, when they were supposed to be becoming one person.\n\nThis time, though, he withdrew easily: sparking prickles, electric laughter. <As you will. Show me, Mahit? I want to see it again.>\n\nWhen she gazed down at the City again\u2014closer now, the skyport rising to meet her skiff like a flower made of scooping nets\u2014she let the imago look through her eyes and felt his rush of exhilaration as if it were her own.\n\nWhat\u2019s down there, she thought. For you.\n\n<The world,> said her imago, who had been Ambassador from Lsel in the City when he was still a living person and not part of a long chain of live memory. He said it in the Teixcalaanli language, which made it a tautology: the word for \u201cworld\u201d and the word for \u201cthe City\u201d were the same, as was the word for \u201cempire.\u201d It was impossible to specify, especially in the high imperial dialect. One had to note the context.\n\nYskandr\u2019s context was obfuscating, which Mahit had come to expect of him. She coped. Despite all her years of studying Teixcalaanli language and literature, his fluency had a different quality than hers, the sort that only came from immersive practice.\n\n<The world,> he said again, <but also the edges of the world.> The Empire, but also where the Empire stops.\n\nMahit matched his language and spoke out loud in Teixcalaanli, since there was no one but her in the seed-skiff. \u201cYou\u2019ve said something meaningless.\u201d\n\n<Yes,> Yskandr agreed. <When I was ambassador it was my habit to say all sorts of meaningless things. You should try it. It\u2019s quite enjoyable.>\n\nIn the privacy of her body, Yskandr used the most intimate forms of address, as if he and Mahit were clonesibs or lovers. Mahit had never spoken them out loud. She had a natural younger brother back on Lsel Station, the closest she would ever get to a clonesib, but her brother only spoke the Stationers\u2019 language, and calling him \u201cyou,\u201d intimate-otherself in Teixcalaanli, would have been both pointless and unkind. She could have said \u201cyou\u201d to a few people who had been in those language and literature courses with her\u2014her old friend and classmate Shrja Torel would have taken the compliment correctly, for instance, but Mahit and Shrja hadn\u2019t spoken since Mahit had been picked to be the new Ambassador to Teixcalaan and carry the imago of the previous one. The why of that little breakage between them was obvious, and petty, and Mahit regretted it\u2014and it wasn\u2019t something she was going to get a chance to repair, except by apologetic letter from the center of the Empire both she and Shrja had wanted to see. Which almost certainly wouldn\u2019t help.\n\nThe City had come closer: it filled up the horizon, a vast curve she was falling into. To Yskandr, she thought, I am the Ambassador now. I might speak meaningfully. If I wanted.\n\n<You speak correctly,> Yskandr said, which was the sort of compliment the Teixcalaanlitzlim gave to a still-cr\u00e8ched child.\n\nGravity caught at the seed-skiff and sank into the bones in Mahit\u2019s thighs and forearms, giving her the sensation of spin. It was dizzying. Below her the skyport\u2019s nets flared open. For a moment she thought she was falling, that she would fall all the way to the planet\u2019s surface and smear to paste on the ground.\n\n<It was the same for me,> Yskandr said quickly, in that Stationers\u2019 language that was Mahit\u2019s native tongue. <Don\u2019t be afraid, Mahit. You are not falling. It is the planet.>\n\nThe skyport caught her with hardly a bump.\n\nShe had time to gather herself together. There was some business with the seed-skiff being shunted into a long line of other such vessels, moving along a great conveyor until each one could be identified and come to its assigned gate. Mahit found herself rehearsing what she would say to the imperial citizens on the other side as if she was a first-year student preparing for an oral examination. In the back of her mind, the imago was a watchful, thrumming presence. Every so often he moved her left hand, the fingers tapping along her harness, someone else\u2019s nervous gesture. Mahit wished they\u2019d had longer to get used to each other.\n\nBut she hadn\u2019t undergone the normal process of having an imago implanted, complete with a year or more of integration therapy under the precise care of one of Lsel\u2019s psychotherapists: she and Yskandr had had a scant three months together, and now they were approaching the place where they\u2019d need to work together\u2014work as one person, compiled out of a memory-chain and a new host.\n\nWhen Ascension\u2019s Red Harvest had arrived, hanging in parallel orbit around Lsel Station\u2019s sun, and had demanded a new ambassador to take back to Teixcalaan, they had refused to explain what had happened to the previous one. Mahit was sure there had been a great deal of politics on the Lsel Council as to what\u2014and who\u2014to send back, and with what demands for information. But this she knew was true: she herself had been one of the few Stationers both old enough for the job and young enough not to have already been brought into an imago-line\u2014and one of the fewer still within that group who had any of the appropriate aptitudes or training for diplomacy. Of those, Mahit had been the best. Her scores on the Imperial Examinations in Teixcalaanli language and literature had approached those of an imperial citizen, and she\u2019d been proud of that\u2014spent the half year since the exams imagining that she would come to the City, sometime in her middle age, once she was established, and collect experiences\u2014attending whatever salons were open to noncitizens that season\u2014gathering up information for whoever she\u2019d share her memory with after she died.\n\nNow she\u2019d get to the City, all right: more important than any Teixcalaanli examination, her scores on the imago-aptitudes had come up green, green, green for this match. Her imago would be Yskandr Aghavn, the previous Ambassador to Teixcalaan. Who was now somehow unsuitable to that empire\u2014dead, or disgraced, or held captive if still alive. Mahit\u2019s instructions from her government included determining precisely what had gone so wrong with him\u2014but she still had his imago. He\u2014or, at least, the last version of him available to give her, fifteen years out of date\u2014was the closest thing Lsel could provide to a native guide to the Teixcalaanli court. Not for the first time, Mahit wondered whether or not there would be a Yskandr waiting for her in the flesh when she stepped outside. She was not sure which would be easier, having one\u2014a disgraced ambassador? A competitor for her, but perhaps salvageable?\u2014or not having one, which meant he had died without ever giving to any younger person what he had learned in his lifetime.\n\nThe imago-Yskandr in her head was hardly older than she was, which was both helpful in finding commonality and uncomfortable\u2014most imagos were elders or victims of early-death accidents\u2014but the last record of Yskandr\u2019s knowledge and memory had been taken when he\u2019d last returned to Lsel on leave from his post in Teixcalaan, only five years after he had first gone down to the City. It had been another decade and a half since then.\n\nSo he was young, and so was she, and whatever advantage to integration that might have granted the two of them was belied by how short a time they\u2019d been together. Two weeks between the courier\u2019s arrival and when Mahit learned that she\u2019d be the next ambassador. Three more weeks for her and Yskandr to learn how to live together in the body that used to belong to her alone, under the supervision of the Station\u2019s psychotherapists. A long, slow time on Ascension\u2019s Red Harvest, traversing the sublight distances between the jumpgates that were scattered like jewels throughout Teixcalaanli space.\n\nThe seed-skiff peeled open like a ripe fruit. Mahit\u2019s harness retracted. Taking hold of her luggage in both hands, she stepped onto the gate, and thus into Teixcalaan itself.\n\nThe skyport gate had an airy utilitarianism constructed of wear-resistant carpet and clearly marked signage between glass-and-steel-paneled walls. Standing in the center of the gate\u2019s connecting tunnel, a precise halfway between the seed-skiff and the skyport proper, was a single Teixcalaanli imperial official in a perfectly cut cream suit. She was small: narrow at the shoulder and hip, much shorter than Mahit, and she wore her hair in a fishtail-braid queue of black that spilled over her left lapel. Her sleeves, wide like bells, shaded through flame-orange at the upper arm\u2014<Information Ministry coloring,> Yskandr told Mahit\u2014down to the deep red cuffs that were the privilege of the titled members of the court. Over her left eye she wore a cloudhook, a glass eyepiece full of the ceaseless obscuring flow of the imperial information network. Hers was sleekly decorative, much like the rest of her. Her large, dark eyes and thin cheekbones and mouth were more delicate than was fashionable on Teixcalaan, but by Mahit\u2019s Stationer standards she was interesting, if not quite pretty. She touched her fingers together politely in front of her chest and inclined her head to Mahit.\n\nYskandr lifted Mahit\u2019s own hands to make the same gesture\u2014and Mahit dropped the two bags she\u2019d been carrying on the floor with an embarrassing clatter. She was horrified. They hadn\u2019t slipped like that since the first week they\u2019d been together.\n\nFuck, she thought, and heard at the same moment Yskandr say <Fuck.> The doubling wasn\u2019t reassuring.\n\nThe official\u2019s carefully neutral expression did not change. She said, \u201cAmbassador, I am Three Seagrass, asekreta and patrician second-class. It is my honor to welcome you into the Jewel of the World. I will be serving as your cultural liaison at the command of His Imperial Majesty Six Direction.\u201d There was a long pause, and then the official gave a small sigh and went on: \u201cDo you require some sort of assistance with your belongings?\u201d\n\n\u201cThree Seagrass\u201d was an old-fashioned Teixcalaanli name: the numeral half was low value, and the noun half was the name of a plant, even if it was a plant Mahit hadn\u2019t seen used in a name before. All of the noun parts of Teixcalaanli names were plants or tools or inanimate objects, but most of the plant ones were flowers. \u201cSeagrass\u201d was memorable. Asekreta meant she was not only Information Ministry, as her suit suggested, but a trained agent of rank, as well as holding the court title of patrician second-class: an aristocrat, but not a very important or rich one.\n\nMahit left her hands where Yskandr had put them, which was where they belonged no matter how angry she was at how they\u2019d gotten there, and bowed over them. \u201cAmbassador Mahit Dzmare of Lsel Station. At your service and that of His Majesty, may his reign be a radiant blaze upon the void.\u201d Since this was her first official contact with a member of the Teixcalaanli court, she used the imperial honorific she\u2019d picked carefully in consultation with Yskandr and the Council government on Lsel: \u201cradiant blaze\u201d was the epithet for the Emperor Twelve Solar-Flare in The Expansion History as Attributed to Pseudo-Thirteen River, the oldest account of imperial presence in Stationer space. Using it now was thus a sign of both Mahit\u2019s erudition and her respect for Six Direction and his office; but \u201cthe void\u201d carefully avoided any intimation of Teixcalaanli claim on parts of Stationer space which were not, in fact, space.\n\nWhether Three Seagrass was aware of the implications of reference was somewhat difficult to tell. She waited patiently while Mahit scooped up her luggage again, and then said, \u201cKeep a tight grip on those. You are urgently awaited in the Judiciary concerning the previous ambassador, and you may need to greet all sorts of people along the way.\u201d\n\nFine. Mahit wouldn\u2019t underestimate Three Seagrass\u2019s capability to be snide, nor her capability to be clever. She nodded, and when the other woman turned smartly and walked up the tunnel, she followed.\n\n<Don\u2019t underestimate any of them,> Yskandr said. <A cultural liaison has been at court for half as long as you\u2019ve been alive. She earned the post.>\n\nDon\u2019t lecture me when you\u2019ve just made me look like a flustered barbarian.\n\n<Do you want me to apologize?>\n\nAre you sorry?\n\nMahit could imagine his facial expression all too easily: arch, as calm as a Teixcalaanlitzlim, the lusher mouth she remembered from holographs of him dragging her own lips up and askew. <I wouldn\u2019t want you to feel like a barbarian. You\u2019ll get enough of that from them.>\n\nHe wasn\u2019t sorry. It was marginally possible that he was embarrassed, but if he was, he wasn\u2019t feeling it with her endocrine system.\n\n\n\n* * *\n\n\n\nYskandr got her through the next half hour. Mahit couldn\u2019t even resent him for it. He behaved exactly like an imago ought to behave: a repository of instinctive and automatic skill that Mahit hadn\u2019t had time to acquire for herself. He knew when to duck through doorways built for Teixcalaanlitzlim instead of Stationers; when to avert her eyes from the rising glare of the City reflected in the glass of the elevator that crawled down the outside of the skyport; how high to step to climb into Three Seagrass\u2019s groundcar. He performed courtesy ritual like a native. After the incident with the luggage he was careful about actually moving Mahit\u2019s hands, but she let him have charge of how long she maintained eye contact and with whom, the degree to which her head was inclined in greeting, all the little ways of signaling that she was less of an alien, less of a barbarian, something that might belong in the City. Protective coloration. Going native without ever having to be a native. She could feel curious eyes slide off of her and fixate on the far more interesting court dress of Three Seagrass, and wondered how much Yskandr had loved the City, to be this good at being in it.\n\nIn the groundcar, Three Seagrass asked, \u201cHave you been within the world long?\u201d\n\nMahit needed to stop thinking in any language but Teixcalaanli. What Three Seagrass meant was a standard bit of politesse small talk, a have you ever been to my country before, and Mahit had heard it like an existential question.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she said, \u201cbut I have read the classics since I was a very small child, and I have thought often of the City.\u201d\n\nThree Seagrass seemed to approve of this answer. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to bore you, Ambassador,\u201d she said, \u201cbut if you\u2019d like a brief and verbal tour of what we\u2019re passing by, I\u2019d be pleased to recite an appropriate poem.\u201d She flicked a control button on her side of the car, and the windows faded to transparency.\n\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be bored,\u201d Mahit said honestly. Outside, the city was a blur of steel and pale stone, neon lights crawling up and down the glass walls of its skyscrapers. They were on one of the central ring roads, spiraling inward through municipal buildings toward the palace itself. Properly, it was more of a city-within-a-city than a palace. By statistics, it had several hundred thousand inhabitants, all of whom were responsible in some minute fashion for the functioning of the Empire, from the gardeners on up to Six Direction himself: each of them plugged into the information network that was guaranteed to imperial citizens, and every last one bathed in a constant flow of data that told them where to be, what to do, how the story of their day and week and epoch would go.\n\nThree Seagrass had an excellent voice. She was reciting The Buildings\u2014a seventeen-thousand-line poem which described the City\u2019s architecture. Mahit didn\u2019t know the precise version she\u2019d picked to declaim, but that might have been Mahit\u2019s own fault. She had her own favorite narrative poems from the Teixcalaanli canon, and she\u2019d memorized as many of them as she could in imitation of Teixcalaanli literati (and to pass the oral portions of the examinations), but The Buildings had always seemed too dull to bother with. It was different now, hearing Three Seagrass recite it as they passed the structures being described. She was a fluent orator, and she had enough command of the metrical scheme to add amusing and relevant original detail where improvisation was appropriate. Mahit folded her hands across her lap and watched the poetry going by through the glass windows of the groundcar.\n\nThis was the City, then, the Jewel of the World, the heart of the Empire: a collapse between narrative and perception, Three Seagrass making adjustments on the fly to the canonical Buildings when some building had changed. After some time she realized that Yskandr was reciting along with Three Seagrass, a dim whisper in the back of her mind, and also that she found the whisper reassuring. He knew this poem, and thus she knew it too, if she needed to know it. That was what imago-lines were for, after all: making sure useful memory was preserved, generation to generation.\n\nThey traveled through forty-five minutes and two traffic snarls before Three Seagrass concluded her stanza and stopped the groundcar at the base of a needlelike pillar of a building, quite near the center of the palace grounds. <Judiciary complex,> Yskandr said.\n\nGood sign or bad sign? Mahit asked him.\n\n<It depends. I wonder what I did.>\n\nSomething illegal. Come on, Yskandr, give me a general sense of the possibilities here. What would you do to get yourself thrown in jail?\n\nMahit got the impression of Yskandr sighing at her, but also the queasy sensation of someone else\u2019s nervousness setting off her adrenal glands. <Mm. Sedition, mostly.>\n\nShe wished she could be sure he was joking.\n\nSurrounding the pillar of the Judiciary was a perimeter of grey-uniformed guards, clustered more closely at the door: a security checkpoint. The guards carried long, slim dark grey sticks rather than the energy weapons that the Teixcalaanli legions favored. Mahit had seen a lot of the latter on Ascension\u2019s Red Harvest, but not these.\n\n<Shocksticks,> Yskandr said. <Electricity-based crowd control\u2014these were not here when I was last here. They\u2019re anti-riot gear, or at least they are in tabloid entertainments.>\n\nYou\u2019re fifteen years out of date, Mahit thought. A lot might have changed\u2014\n\n<This is the center of the palace. If they\u2019re worried about riots at the Judiciary, something hasn\u2019t changed, something is wrong. Now go find out what I did.>\n\nMahit wondered what had gone sufficiently wrong to create security theater at the door of the Judiciary, and if Yskandr had helped it go that wrong\u2014felt prickles go up the back of her spine and down through her arms, the ulnar nerves crawling unpleasantly\u2014and then had no time for more distressing reflection, as Three Seagrass was escorting her through. She offered up her thumbprints as well as Mahit\u2019s, and stood with her eyes politely averted as a Teixcalaanli security guard patted chastely at the pockets of Mahit\u2019s traveling jacket and her trousers. Her luggage was decorously placed in their custody, and she was promised that she could have it back on her way out.\n\nOnce the guard was done breaking all of Mahit\u2019s personal space taboos, she advised Mahit to avoid wandering off without escort, as her identity was neither recorded on cloudhook nor otherwise authorized to be present within the Judiciary. Mahit raised an inquiring eyebrow at Three Seagrass.\n\n\u201cThere were questions of speed,\u201d Three Seagrass said, proceeding briskly through a multiplicity of irising doors into a cool, slate-floored interior, toward the elevator bank. \u201cYour registration and permission to move about the palace complex will of course be taken care of as soon as is possible.\u201d\n\nMahit said, \u201cI\u2019ve been in transit more than a month, and there are questions of speed?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe have been waiting for three months, Ambassador, since we sent for a new representative from the Station.\u201d\n\n<I must have done something quite spectacular,> Yskandr said. <Down below are secret courts and interrogation chambers, or so the palace rumors always went.>\n\nThe elevator chimed in fourths. \u201cAnd one more hour matters, after three months?\u201d\n\nThree Seagrass gestured for Mahit to precede her into the elevator, which was a sort of answer, if not an informative one.\n\nThey descended.\n\nWaiting for them below was a chamber that could have been a courtroom or an operating theater: blue-metal floor, and amphitheater-style benches arrayed around a high table on which lay some large object covered in a sheet. Floodlights. Three Teixcalaanli strangers, all broad-cheekboned and broad-shouldered, one in a red cassock, one dressed identically to Three Seagrass in the orange-and-cream of the Information Ministry, and one in a dark grey suit that reminded Mahit of nothing so much as the metal sheen of the shocksticks. They stood around the table, arguing in low, rapid voices, and blocked Mahit\u2019s view of whatever was lying on it.\n\n\u201cI still would like to make my own examination, for my Ministry, before he\u2019s returned,\u201d said the Information Ministry courtier, annoyed.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a single good reason to just turn him back over to them,\u201d the Teixcalaanlitzlim in red said, with some finality. \u201cIt won\u2019t do us any good and might spark an incident\u2014\u201d\n\nDark Grey Suit disagreed. \u201cContrary to the opinions of your Ministry, ixplanatl, I am entirely certain that any incident they could induce wouldn\u2019t be more trouble than an insect bite, and as easily soothed.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake, argue later,\u201d said the one from Information, \u201cthey\u2019re here.\u201d\n\nThe man in red turned toward them as they entered, as if he had been anticipating their arrival. The ceiling was a low dome. Mahit thought of a bubble of gas, trapped under the earth. Then she understood the shape on the table as a corpse.\n\nIt lay under a thin sheet drawn midway up its bare torso, hands resting on its chest, fingertips touching as if it was preparing to greet some afterlife. Its cheeks were sunken and its open eyes were filmed over with a hazy blue. The same color had infiltrated its lips and nailbeds. It looked like it had been dead a long time. Perhaps \u2026 three months.\n\nAs clearly as if he had been standing next to her, Mahit heard Yskandr say <I got old,> with wondering horror. She was shaking. Her heart raced, drowning out the sound of Three Seagrass introducing her. A dizzying rush, worse than falling toward the planet, panic out of nowhere. Not her panic: Yskandr\u2019s, her imago flooding her with her own stress hormones, enough adrenaline to taste metallic. The mouth of the corpse was slack, but she could see the smile lines at its corners, feel on her own mouth how Yskandr\u2019s muscles would have formed them over time.\n\n\u201cAs you see, Ambassador Dzmare,\u201d said the man in red, whose name Mahit had completely failed to catch during the introductions, \u201ca new ambassador was necessary. I apologize for preserving him in this fashion, but we did not want to disrespect any funereal processes which your people might prefer.\u201d\n\nShe came closer. The corpse stayed dead, stayed still and limp and empty. <Fuck,> Yskandr said, a fizz of nauseating static. Mahit was horribly, helplessly sure she was going to throw up. <Oh, fuck, I can\u2019t do this.>\n\nMahit thought (or Yskandr thought\u2014she was having trouble keeping them apart, and this wasn\u2019t how the integration was supposed to go, she was never supposed to be lost inside his biochemical panic response hijacking her own endocrine system) about how the only place that Yskandr existed now was inside her head. She\u2019d considered that he was dead, when Teixcalaan had demanded a new ambassador, thought about it intellectually, planned for it, and yet\u2014here he was\u2014a corpse, a hollow rotting shell, and she was panicking because her imago was panicking and an emotion-spike was the easiest way to fuck up an integration that wasn\u2019t finished, an emotion-spike would burn out all the tiny microcircuits in the machine in her mind and oh fuck he was dead and oh fuck I am dead and the blur, the nauseating blur of everything.\n\nYskandr, she tried, aiming for comfort and missing by a long distance.\n\n<Get closer,> he told her, <I need to see. I\u2019m not sure\u2014>\n\nHe moved them before she could decide to do what he asked. It was like she\u2019d blacked out for the space of time it took to approach the corpse, blinked and was there, and this was going so very, very awry, and she couldn\u2019t stop it\u2014\n\n\u201cWe burn our dead,\u201d she said, and didn\u2019t know who to thank for the fact that she\u2019d said it in the right language.\n\n\u201cHow interesting a custom,\u201d said the courtier in dark grey. Mahit thought he was from the Judiciary itself; this was likely to be his morgue, even if it was the man in red who was the mortician.\n\nMahit smiled at him, too wide for her face and too uncontrolled for Yskandr\u2019s, an expression that\u2019d horrify any serene Teixcalaanlitzlim. \u201cAfterward,\u201d she said, searching for the correct vocabulary, a spar to cling to through the roiling waves of adrenaline, \u201cwe eat the ashes as a sacred thing. His children and successors first. If he had any.\u201d\n\nThe courtier had the grace to blanch and the stubbornness to repeat himself. \u201cHow interesting a custom.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you do with yours?\u201d Mahit asked. She came nearer Yskandr\u2019s corpse, drifting. Her mouth seemed to be under her control for the moment, but her feet belonged to Yskandr. \u201cExcuse my inquiry. I am, after all, not a citizen.\u201d\n\nThe man in red said, \u201cBurial is common,\u201d as if it was a question he answered every day. \u201cDo you wish to examine the body, Ambassador?\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there some reason I should do so?\u201d Mahit said, but she was already pulling down the sheet. Her fingers were sweating, slick on the fabric. Underneath, the corpse was naked, a fortyish man with all of his skin tinged that same blue at its most translucent points. An injectable preservative, all through him. The injection points were strikingly visible, holes surrounded by a halo of pale, swollen flesh\u2014at the carotid, and in the ulnar veins of both arms. There was an extra injection site at the base of the corpse\u2019s right thumb, distorting the shape of the hand. She found herself staring at it, in another one of those blanked-out moments\u2014she\u2019d been looking at his face, and now she was looking at his wrist, as if the imago needed to see every place his former body had been altered. Even if Mahit had wanted to claim her rights as his successor to the dust of his flesh\u2014and she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted to\u2014she thought that it might be a very stupid idea to ingest whatever the man in red had filled him up with. Three months without rotting. She could taste bile in her throat, under the metallic endocrine cascade. Bodies should decompose, and be recycled.\n\nBut the Empire preserved everything, told the same stories over and over again; why not also preserve flesh instead of rendering it up for decent use?\n\nShe was touching the wrist, the imago tracing her fingertip over the injection site, and then further, into the palm, following the line of some scar. The flesh was rubbery, plasticky, too much give and not enough all at once\u2014her Yskandr hadn\u2019t gotten that scar yet; her Yskandr wasn\u2019t dead yet\u2014there was another one of those dizzying nauseous waves, the edges of her vision irising to fizz and sparks, and she thought again We are going to blow out all the circuitry, stop it\u2014\n\n<I can\u2019t,> Yskandr said again, an enormous negation inside her mind, an avulsion that felt like a spark gone to ground\u2014and then he was gone.\n\nDead quiet. Not even the feeling of him watching through Mahit\u2019s eyes. She felt gravityless, full of endorphins she hadn\u2019t produced on purpose, and horribly alone. Her tongue was heavy. It tasted like aluminum.\n\nNothing like this had ever happened to her before.\n\n\u201cHow did he die?\u201d she asked, and was amazed that she sounded entirely normal, entirely unfazed; asked for the sake of continuing to talk. None of the Teixcalaanli knew about imagos, none of them would even be able to understand what had just happened to her.\n\n\u201cHe choked on the air,\u201d the man in red said, touching the corpse\u2019s neck with a practiced span of two fingers. \u201cHis throat closed. It was very unfortunate; but the physiologies of noncitizens are often so different from ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe ate something he was allergic to?\u201d Mahit asked. This seemed absurd. She was shock-numb, and apparently Yskandr had died of anaphylaxis, and if she wasn\u2019t careful she was going to have a hysterical laughing fit.\n\n\u201cAt dinner with the Minister for Science Ten Pearl, no less,\u201d said the last courtier, the one from Information. This one looked like he\u2019d climbed out of a classical Teixcalaanli painting: his features were unbelievably symmetrical: lush mouth, low forehead, perfectly hooked nose; eyes like deep brown pools. \u201cYou should have seen the newsfeeds afterward, Ambassador; it was quite the tabloid story.\u201d\n\n\u201cTwelve Azalea means no disrespect,\u201d said Three Seagrass from where she stood by the door. \u201cThe news went no farther than the palace complex. It would be inappropriate for the general population.\u201d\n\nMahit pulled the sheet back up to the corpse\u2019s chin. It didn\u2019t help. He was still there. \u201cWas the story also inappropriate for the stations?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe courier who asked for my service within the City was unnecessarily vague.\u201d\n\nThree Seagrass shrugged, a minute shift of one shoulder. \u201cAmbassador, while I am asekreta, not every asekreta is privy to the decisions of the Information Ministry as a whole.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would you like done with his body?\u201d inquired the man in red. Mahit looked up at him; he was tall for a Teixcalaanlitzlim. His eyes, an unnervingly friendly green, were almost even with hers. She had no idea what to do with a corpse. She had never burnt anyone herself; she was too young. Her parents were both still living. And besides, what you did was you called the funeral manager and they handled it, preferably while someone you loved held your hand and cried with you over the mutual loss.\n\nShe had less idea what to do with this corpse. No one was going to cry over Yskandr, even her, and there weren\u2019t any funeral managers in Teixcalaanli space who would know where to begin.\n\nShe managed, \u201cNothing yet,\u201d and swallowed hard against the remains of the nausea. Her fingers felt electric, all prickle-shimmer where they had touched the dead man\u2019s skin. \u201cI will of course make arrangements once I am better acquainted with the facilities available. Until then, well, he\u2019s not going to rot, is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly very slowly,\u201d the man in red said.\n\n\u201cSir\u2014\u201d Mahit looked to Three Seagrass for help; she was a cultural liaison so she could damn well liaise\u2014\n\n\u201cIxplanatl Four Lever,\u201d Three Seagrass said obligingly. \u201cOf the Science Ministry.\u201d\n\n\u201cFour Lever,\u201d Mahit went on, dropping the man\u2019s title\u2014it meant \u201cscientist,\u201d in a very general sense, scientist-with-credentials\u2014entirely on purpose, \u201cwhen will the rot be noticeable? Another two months, perhaps?\u201d\n\nFour Lever smiled enough to show off a sliver of teeth. \u201cTwo years, Ambassador.\u201d\n\n\u201cExcellent,\u201d Mahit said. \u201cThat will be plenty of time.\u201d\n\nFour Lever bowed over the triangular press of his fingertips, as if she\u2019d given him an order. Mahit suspected she was being indulged. She\u2019d take it. She had to. She needed space enough to think and she wasn\u2019t going to get it here, in the bowels of the Judiciary with three courtiers and a ixplanatl morgue attendant all waiting for her to make some irrevocable error and end up like Yskandr had.\n\nBetrayed by his own physiology.

{"story_id": "the_call_of_the_wild_scene", "text": "from a dead standstill. Matthewson insisted that the phrase included\nbreaking the runners from the frozen grip of the snow. A majority of\nthe men who had witnessed the making of the bet decided in his favor,\nwhereat the odds went up to three to one against Buck.\n\nThere were no takers. Not a man believed him capable of the feat.\nThornton had been hurried into the wager, heavy with doubt; and now\nthat he looked at the sled itself, the concrete fact, with the regular\nteam of ten dogs curled up in the snow before it, the more impossible\nthe task appeared. Matthewson waxed jubilant.\n\n\u201cThree to one!\u201d he proclaimed. \u201cI\u2019ll lay you another thousand at that\nfigure, Thornton. What d\u2019ye say?\u201d\n\nThornton\u2019s doubt was strong in his face, but his fighting spirit was\naroused\u2014the fighting spirit that soars above odds, fails to recognize\nthe impossible, and is deaf to all save the clamor for battle. He\ncalled Hans and Pete to him. Their sacks were slim, and with his own\nthe three partners could rake together only two hundred dollars. In the\nebb of their fortunes, this sum was their total capital; yet they laid\nit unhesitatingly against Matthewson\u2019s six hundred.\n\nThe team of ten dogs was unhitched, and Buck, with his own harness, was\nput into the sled. He had caught the contagion of the excitement, and\nhe felt that in some way he must do a great thing for John Thornton.\nMurmurs of admiration at his splendid appearance went up. He was in\nperfect condition, without an ounce of superfluous flesh, and the one\nhundred and fifty pounds that he weighed were so many pounds of grit\nand virility. His furry coat shone with the sheen of silk. Down the\nneck and across the shoulders, his mane, in repose as it was, half\nbristled and seemed to lift with every movement, as though excess of\nvigor made each particular hair alive and active. The great breast and\nheavy fore legs were no more than in proportion with the rest of the\nbody, where the muscles showed in tight rolls underneath the skin. Men\nfelt these muscles and proclaimed them hard as iron, and the odds went\ndown to two to one.\n\n\u201cGad, sir! Gad, sir!\u201d stuttered a member of the latest dynasty, a king\nof the Skookum Benches. \u201cI offer you eight hundred for him, sir, before\nthe test, sir; eight hundred just as he stands.\u201d\n\nThornton shook his head and stepped to Buck\u2019s side.\n\n\u201cYou must stand off from him,\u201d Matthewson protested. \u201cFree play and\nplenty of room.\u201d\n\nThe crowd fell silent; only could be heard the voices of the gamblers\nvainly offering two to one. Everybody acknowledged Buck a magnificent\nanimal, but twenty fifty-pound sacks of flour bulked too large in their\neyes for them to loosen their pouch-strings.\n\nThornton knelt down by Buck\u2019s side. He took his head in his two hands\nand rested cheek on cheek. He did not playfully shake him, as was his\nwont, or murmur soft love curses; but he whispered in his ear. \u201cAs you\nlove me, Buck. As you love me,\u201d was what he whispered. Buck whined with\nsuppressed eagerness.\n\nThe crowd was watching curiously. The affair was growing mysterious. It\nseemed like a conjuration. As Thornton got to his feet, Buck seized his\nmittened hand between his jaws, pressing in with his teeth and\nreleasing slowly, half-reluctantly. It was the answer, in terms, not of\nspeech, but of love. Thornton stepped well back.\n\n\u201cNow, Buck,\u201d he said.\n\nBuck tightened the traces, then slacked them for a matter of several\ninches. It was the way he had learned.\n\n\u201cGee!\u201d Thornton\u2019s voice rang out, sharp in the tense silence.\n\nBuck swung to the right, ending the movement in a plunge that took up\nthe slack and with a sudden jerk arrested his one hundred and fifty\npounds. The load quivered, and from under the runners arose a crisp\ncrackling.\n\n\u201cHaw!\u201d Thornton commanded.\n\nBuck duplicated the man\u0153uvre, this time to the left. The crackling\nturned into a snapping, the sled pivoting and the runners slipping and\ngrating several inches to the side. The sled was broken out. Men were\nholding their breaths, intensely unconscious of the fact.\n\n\u201cNow, MUSH!\u201d\n\nThornton\u2019s command cracked out like a pistol-shot. Buck threw himself\nforward, tightening the traces with a jarring lunge. His whole body was\ngathered compactly together in the tremendous effort, the muscles\nwrithing and knotting like live things under the silky fur. His great\nchest was low to the ground, his head forward and down, while his feet\nwere flying like mad, the claws scarring the hard-packed snow in\nparallel grooves. The sled swayed and trembled, half-started forward.\nOne of his feet slipped, and one man groaned aloud. Then the sled\nlurched ahead in what appeared a rapid succession of jerks, though it\nnever really came to a dead stop again...half an inch...an inch... two\ninches... The jerks perceptibly diminished; as the sled gained\nmomentum, he caught them up, till it was moving steadily along.\n\nMen gasped and began to breathe again, unaware that for a moment they\nhad ceased to breathe. Thornton was running behind, encouraging Buck\nwith short, cheery words. The distance had been measured off, and as he\nneared the pile of firewood which marked the end of the hundred yards,\na cheer began to grow and grow, which burst into a roar as he passed\nthe firewood and halted at command. Every man was tearing himself\nloose, even Matthewson. Hats and mittens were flying in the air. Men\nwere shaking hands, it did not matter with whom, and bubbling over in a\ngeneral incoherent babel.\n\nBut Thornton fell on his knees beside Buck. Head was against head, and\nhe was shaking him back and forth. Those who hurried up heard him\ncursing Buck, and he cursed him long and fervently, and softly and\nlovingly.\n\n\u201cGad, sir! Gad, sir!\u201d spluttered the Skookum Bench king. \u201cI\u2019ll give you\na thousand for him, sir, a thousand, sir\u2014twelve hundred, sir.\u201d\n\nThornton rose to his feet. His eyes were wet. The tears were streaming\nfrankly down his cheeks. \u201cSir,\u201d he said to the Skookum Bench king, \u201cno,\nsir. You can go to hell, sir. It\u2019s the best I can do for you, sir.\u201d\n\nBuck seized Thornton\u2019s hand in his teeth. Thornton shook him back and\nforth. As though animated by a common impulse, the onlookers drew back\nto a respectful distance; nor were they again indiscreet enough to\ninterrupt.", "characters": [{"name": "Buck", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Hans", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "John", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Matthewson", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Pete", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Thornton", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "classic", "source": "validation", "book": "The Call of the Wild", "entity_density": 0.037}}
{"story_id": "jane_eyre_scene", "text": "Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up. Within the arch, the\nbulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise\nchosen, was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him, on a table,\nlay open a large book; and at his side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr.\nRochester\u2019s cloak, and holding a book in her hand. Somebody, unseen,\nrang the bell merrily; then Ad\u00e8le (who had insisted on being one of her\nguardian\u2019s party), bounded forward, scattering round her the contents\nof a basket of flowers she carried on her arm. Then appeared the\nmagnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her\nhead, and a wreath of roses round her brow; by her side walked Mr.\nRochester, and together they drew near the table. They knelt; while\nMrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up their\nstations behind them. A ceremony followed, in dumb show, in which it\nwas easy to recognise the pantomime of a marriage. At its termination,\nColonel Dent and his party consulted in whispers for two minutes, then\nthe Colonel called out\u2014\n\n\u201cBride!\u201d Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell.\n\nA considerable interval elapsed before it again rose. Its second rising\ndisplayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last. The\ndrawing-room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the\ndining-room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two\nback within the room, appeared a large marble basin, which I recognised\nas an ornament of the conservatory\u2014where it usually stood, surrounded\nby exotics, and tenanted by gold fish\u2014and whence it must have been\ntransported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.\n\nSeated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr.\nRochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his head. His dark eyes\nand swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he\nlooked the very model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the\nbowstring. Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram. She, too, was\nattired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the\nwaist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her temples; her\nbeautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of\nsupporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her head. Both her cast of\nform and feature, her complexion and her general air, suggested the\nidea of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was\ndoubtless the character she intended to represent.\n\nShe approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her pitcher;\nshe again lifted it to her head. The personage on the well-brink now\nseemed to accost her; to make some request:\u2014\u201cShe hasted, let down her\npitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.\u201d From the bosom of his robe\nhe then produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets\nand earrings; she acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he laid\nthe treasure at her feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her\nlooks and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her arms and\nthe rings in her ears. It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were\nwanting.\n\nThe divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they\ncould not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.\nColonel Dent, their spokesman, demanded \u201cthe tableau of the whole;\u201d\nwhereupon the curtain again descended.\n\nOn its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed;\nthe rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and\ncoarse drapery. The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a\ndeal table and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very\ndim light proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all\nextinguished.\n\nAmidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his clenched hands resting on\nhis knees, and his eyes bent on the ground. I knew Mr. Rochester;\nthough the begrimed face, the disordered dress (his coat hanging loose\nfrom one arm, as if it had been almost torn from his back in a\nscuffle), the desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling\nhair might well have disguised him. As he moved, a chain clanked; to\nhis wrists were attached fetters.\n\n\u201cBridewell!\u201d exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.", "characters": [{"name": "Ad\u00e8le", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Amy", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Colonel Dent", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Eshton", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Ingram", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Louisa", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Miss Ingram", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Mrs. Dent", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Rochester", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Sir George Lynn", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "classic", "source": "validation", "book": "Jane Eyre", "entity_density": 0.0271}}

I have just one word to say of the\nwhole tribe; they are a nuisance. Not that I ever suffered much from\nthem; I took care to turn the tables. What tricks Theodore and I used\nto play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts! Mary\nwas always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit. The best fun was\nwith Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose\nand low-spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and\nMrs. Grey was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.

Theodore, do you remember\nthose merry days?\u201d\n\n\u201cYaas, to be sure I do,\u201d drawled Lord Ingram; \u201cand the poor old stick\nused to cry out, \u2018Oh you villains childs!\u2019\u2014and then we sermonised her on\nthe presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were,\nwhen she was herself so ignorant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or\npersecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining\u2014the parson in the pip,\nas we used to call him. He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling\nin love with each other\u2014at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised\nsundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of \u2018la\nbelle passion,\u2019 and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of\nour discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our\ndead-weights from the house. Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an\ninkling of the business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.\nDid you not, my lady-mother?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly, my best. And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a\nthousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should\nnever be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, gracious, mama! Spare us the enumeration! _Au reste_, we all know\nthem: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and\nconsequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached\u2014mutual alliance\nand reliance; confidence thence resulting\u2014insolence accompanying\u2014mutiny\nand general blow-up. Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy lily-flower, you are right now, as always.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen no more need be said: change the subject.\u201d\n\nAmy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her\nsoft, infantine tone: \u201cLouisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but\nshe was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her\nout. She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her\nworkbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured,\nshe would give us anything we asked for.\u201d\n\n\u201cI suppose, now,\u201d said Miss Ingram, curling her lip sarcastically, \u201cwe\nshall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in\norder to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a\nnew topic. Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?\u201d\n\n\u201cMadam, I support you on this point, as on every other.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen on me be the onus of bringing it forward.

Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?\u201d cried\nMr. Rochester.\n\n\u201cI should say the preference lies with you,\u201d responded Colonel Dent.\n\n\u201cOn my honour, I am much obliged to you,\u201d was the reply.\n\nMiss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano,\nspreading out her snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a\nbrilliant prelude; talking meantime. She appeared to be on her high\nhorse to-night; both her words and her air seemed intended to excite\nnot only the admiration, but the amazement of her auditors: she was\nevidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring\nindeed.\n\n\u201cOh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!\u201d exclaimed she,\nrattling away at the instrument. \u201cPoor, puny things, not fit to stir a\nstep beyond papa\u2019s park gates: nor to go even so far without mama\u2019s\npermission and guardianship!

As she approached the far wall, she could see a splintery wooden door set in the room\u2019s corner. A man seated by the door caught her eyes, nodded slightly, and pushed the door open. Vin passed quickly into the small room beyond.\n\n\u201cVin, my dear!\u201d Breeze said, lounging at a table near the center of the room. \u201cWelcome! How was Fellise?\u201d\n\nVin shrugged, taking a seat at the table.\n\n\u201cAh,\u201d Breeze said. \u201cI\u2019d almost forgotten what a fascinating conversationalist you are. Wine?\u201d\n\nVin shook her head.\n\n\u201cWell, I would certainly like some.\u201d Breeze wore one of his extravagant suits, dueling cane resting across his lap. The chamber was only lit by a single lantern, but it was far cleaner than the room outside. Of the four other men in the room, Vin recognized only one\u2014an apprentice from Clubs\u2019s shop. The two by the door were obviously guards. The last man appeared to be a regular skaa worker\u2014complete with blackened jacket and ashen face. His self-confident air, however, proved that he was a member of the underground. Probably one of Yeden\u2019s rebels.\n\nBreeze held up his cup, tapping its side with his fingernail. The rebel regarded it darkly.\n\n\u201cRight now,\u201d Breeze said, \u201cyou\u2019re wondering if I\u2019m using Allomancy on you. Perhaps I am, perhaps I am not. Does it matter? I\u2019m here by your leader\u2019s invitation, and he ordered you to see that I was made comfortable. And, I assure you, a cup of wine in my hand is absolutely necessary for my comfort.\u201d\n\nThe skaa man waited for a moment, then snatched the cup and stalked away, grumbling under his breath about foolish costs and wasted resources.\n\nBreeze raised an eyebrow, turning to Vin. He seemed quite pleased with himself.\n\n\u201cSo, did you Push him?\u201d she asked.\n\nBreeze shook his head. \u201cWaste of brass. Did Kelsier tell you why he asked you to come here today?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe told me to watch you,\u201d Vin said, a bit annoyed at being handed off to Breeze. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t have time to train me in all the metals.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Breeze said, \u201clet us begin, then. First, you must understand that Soothing is about more than just Allomancy. It\u2019s about the delicate and noble art of manipulation.\u201d\n\n\u201cNoble indeed,\u201d Vin said.\n\n\u201cAh, you sound like one of them,\u201d Breeze said.\n\n\u201cThem who?\u201d\n\n\u201cThem everyone else,\u201d Breeze said. \u201cYou saw how that skaa gentleman treated me? People don\u2019t like us, my dear. The idea of someone who can play with their emotions, who can \u2018mystically\u2019 get them to do certain things, makes them uncomfortable. What they do not realize\u2014and what you must realize\u2014is that manipulating others is something that all people do. In fact, manipulation is at the core of our social interaction.\u201d\n\nHe settled back, raising his dueling cane and gesturing with it slightly as he spoke. \u201cThink about it. What is a man doing when he seeks the affection of a young lady? Why, he is trying to manipulate her to regard him favorably. What happens when two old friends sit down for a drink? They tell stories, trying to impress each other. Life as a human being is about posturing and influence. This isn\u2019t a bad thing\u2014in fact, we depend upon it. These interactions teach us how to respond to others.\u201d\n\nHe paused, pointing at Vin with the cane. \u201cThe difference between Soothers and regular people is that we are aware of what we\u2019re doing. We also have a slight \u2026 advantage. But, is it really that much more \u2018powerful\u2019 than having a charismatic personality or a fine set of teeth? I think not.\u201d\n\nVin paused.\n\n\u201cBesides,\u201d Breeze added, \u201cas I mentioned, a good Soother must be skilled far beyond his ability to use Allomancy. Allomancy can\u2019t let you read minds or even emotions\u2014in a way, you\u2019re as blind as anyone else. You fire off pulses of emotions, targeted at a single person or in an area, and your subjects will have their emotions altered\u2014hopefully producing the effect that you wished. However, great Soothers are those who can successfully use their eyes and instincts to know how a person is feeling before they get Soothed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does it matter how they\u2019re feeling?\u201d Vin said, trying to cover her annoyance. \u201cYou\u2019re just going to Soothe them anyway, right? So, when you\u2019re done, they\u2019ll feel how you want them to.\u201d\n\nBreeze sighed, shaking his head. \u201cWhat would you say if you knew I\u2019d Soothed you on three separate occasions during our conversation?\u201d\n\nVin paused. \u201cWhen?\u201d she demanded.\n\n\u201cDoes it matter?\u201d Breeze asked. \u201cThis is the lesson you must learn, my dear. If you can\u2019t read how someone is feeling, then you\u2019ll never have a subtle touch with emotional Allomancy. Push someone too hard, and even the most blind of skaa will realize that they\u2019re being manipulated somehow. Touch too softly, and you won\u2019t produce a noticeable effect\u2014other, more powerful emotions will still rule your subject.\u201d\n\nBreeze shook his head. \u201cIt\u2019s all about understanding people,\u201d he continued. \u201cYou have to read how someone is feeling, change that feeling by nudging it in the proper direction, then channel their newfound emotional state to your advantage. That, my dear, is the challenge in what we do! It is difficult, but for those who can do it well \u2026\u201d\n\nThe door opened, and the sullen skaa man returned, bearing an entire bottle of wine. He put it and a cup on the table before Breeze, then went over to stand on the other side of the room, beside peepholes looking into the dining room.\n\n\u201cThere are vast rewards,\u201d Breeze said with a quiet smile. He winked at her, then poured some wine.\n\nVin wasn\u2019t certain what to think. Breeze\u2019s opinion seemed cruel. Yet, Reen had trained her well. If she didn\u2019t have power over this thing, others would gain power over her through it. She started burning copper\u2014as Kelsier had taught her\u2014to shield herself from further manipulations on Breeze\u2019s part.\n\nThe door opened again, and a familiar vest-wearing form tromped in. \u201cHey, Vin,\u201d Ham said with a friendly wave. He walked over to the table, eyeing the wine. \u201cBreeze, you know that the rebellion doesn\u2019t have the money for that kind of thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cKelsier will reimburse them,\u201d Breeze said with a dismissive wave. \u201cI simply cannot work with a dry throat. How is the area?\u201d\n\n\u201cSecure,\u201d Ham said. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got Tineyes on the corners just in case. Your bolt-exit is behind that hatch in the corner.\u201d\n\nBreeze nodded, and Ham turned, looking at Clubs\u2019s apprentice. \u201cYou Smoking back there, Cobble?\u201d\n\nThe boy nodded.\n\n\u201cGood lad,\u201d Ham said. \u201cThat\u2019s everything, then. Now we just have to wait for Kell\u2019s speech.\u201d\n\nBreeze checked his pocket watch. \u201cHe\u2019s not scheduled for another few minutes. Shall I have someone fetch you a cup?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll pass,\u201d Ham said.\n\nBreeze shrugged, sipping his wine.\n\nThere was a moment of silence. Finally, Ham spoke. \u201cSo \u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Breeze interrupted.\n\n\u201cBut\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever it is, we don\u2019t want to hear about it.\u201d\n\nHam gave the Soother a flat stare. \u201cYou can\u2019t Push me into complacence, Breeze.\u201d\n\nBreeze rolled his eyes, taking a drink.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d Vin asked. \u201cWhat were you going to say?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t encourage him, my dear,\u201d Breeze said.\n\nVin frowned. She glanced at Ham, who smiled.\n\nBreeze sighed. \u201cJust leave me out of it. I\u2019m not in the mood for one of Ham\u2019s inane debates.\u201d\n\n\u201cIgnore him,\u201d Ham said eagerly, pulling his chair a little bit closer to Vin. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve been wondering. By overthrowing the Final Empire are we doing something good, or are we doing something bad?\u201d\n\nVin paused. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d\n\nHam looked taken aback, but Breeze chuckled. \u201cWell answered,\u201d the Soother said.\n\nHam glared at Breeze, then turned back to Vin. \u201cOf course it matters.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d Vin said, \u201cI guess we\u2019re doing something good. The Final Empire has oppressed the skaa for centuries.\u201d\n\n\u201cRight,\u201d Ham said. \u201cBut, there\u2019s a problem. The Lord Ruler is God, right?\u201d\n\nVin shrugged. \u201cDoes it matter?\u201d\n\nHam glared at her.\n\nShe rolled her eyes. \u201cAll right. The Ministry claims that he is God.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually,\u201d Breeze noted, \u201cthe Lord Ruler is only a piece of God. He is the Sliver of Infinity\u2014not omniscient or omnipresent, but an independent section of a consciousness that is.\u201d\n\nHam sighed. \u201cI thought you didn\u2019t want to be involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust making certain everyone has their facts correct,\u201d Breeze said lightly.\n\n\u201cAnyway,\u201d Ham said. \u201cGod is the creator of all things, right? He is the force that dictates the laws of the universe, and is therefore the ultimate source of ethics. He is absolute morality.\u201d\n\nVin blinked.\n\n\u201cYou see the dilemma?\u201d Ham asked.\n\n\u201cI see an idiot,\u201d Breeze mumbled.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m confused,\u201d Vin said. \u201cWhat\u2019s the problem?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe claim to be doing good,\u201d Ham said. \u201cBut, the Lord Ruler\u2014as God\u2014defines what is good. So, by opposing him we\u2019re actually evil. But, since he\u2019s doing the wrong thing, does evil actually count as good in this case?\u201d\n\nVin frowned.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d Ham asked.\n\n\u201cI think you gave me a headache,\u201d Vin said.\n\n\u201cI warned you,\u201d Breeze noted.\n\nHam sighed. \u201cBut, don\u2019t you think it\u2019s worth thinking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am,\u201d Breeze said.\n\nHam shook his head. \u201cNo one around here likes to have decent, intelligent discussions.\u201d", "characters": [{"name": "Vin", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Breeze", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Ham", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Cobble", "role": "MINOR"}, {"name": "Clubs", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Kelsier", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0487}}
{"story_id": "assassins_apprentice_scene_002", "text": "He has become his father's favorite, Chade growled. Shrewd has done nothing but spoil him since the Queen died. He tries to buy the boy's heart with gifts, now that his mother is no longer around to claim his allegiance. And Regal takes full advantage. He speaks only what the old man loves to hear. And Shrewd gives him too much rein. He lets him wander about, squandering coin on useless visits to Farrow and Tilth, where his mother's people fill Regal full of ideas of his self-importance. The boy should be kept at home and made to give some account for how he spends his time. And the King's money. What he spends gallivanting about would have outfitted a warship. And then, suddenly annoyed: That's too hot! You'll lose it, fish it out quickly.\n\nBut his words came too late, for the crucible cracked with a noise like breaking ice and its contents filled Chade's tower room with an acrid smoke that brought all lessons and talk to an end for that night.\n\nI was not soon summoned again. My other lessons went on, but I missed Chade as the weeks passed and he did not call for me. I knew he was not displeased with me, but only preoccupied. When, idle one day, I pushed my awareness toward him, I felt only secrecy and discordance. And a wallop to the back of my head when Burrich caught me at it.\n\nStop it, he hissed, and ignored my studied look of shocked innocence. He glanced about the stall I was mucking out as if he expected to find a dog or cat lurking.\n\nThere's nothing here! he exclaimed.\n\nJust manure and straw, I agreed, rubbing the back of my head.\n\nThen what were you doing?\n\nDaydreaming, I muttered. That was all.\n\nYou can't fool me, Fitz, he growled. And I won't have it. Not in my stables. You won't pervert my beasts that way. Or degrade Chivalry's blood. Mind what I've told you.\n\nI clenched my jaws and lowered my eyes and kept on working. After a time I heard him sigh and move away. I went on raking, inwardly seething and resolving never to let Burrich come up on me unawares again.\n\nThe rest of that summer was such a whirlpool of events that I find it hard to recall their progression. Overnight, the very feeling of the air seemed to change. When I went into town, all of the talk was of fortifications and readiness. Only two more towns were Forged that summer, but it seemed a hundred, for the stories of it were repeated and enlarged from lip to lip.\n\nUntil it seems as if that is all folk talk about anymore, Molly complained to me.\n\nWe were walking on Long Beach, in the light of the summer evening sun. The wind off the water was a welcome bit of cool after a muggy day. Burrich had been called away to Springmouth to see if he could figure out why all the cattle there were developing huge hide sores. It meant no morning lessons for me, but many, many more chores with the horses and hounds in his absence, especially as Cob had gone to Turlake with Regal, to manage his horses and hounds for a summer hunt.\n\nBut the opposite weight of the balance was that my evenings were less supervised, and I had more time to visit town.\n\nMy evening walks with Molly were almost a routine now. Her father's health was failing and he scarcely needed to drink to fall into an early and deep sleep each night. Molly would pack a bit of cheese and sausage for us, or a small loaf and some smoked fish, and we would take a basket and a bottle of cheap wine and walk out down the beach to the breakwater rocks. There we would sit on the rocks as they gave up the last heat of the day, and Molly would tell me about her day's work and the day's gossip and I would listen. Sometimes our elbows bumped as we walked.\n\nSara, the butcher's daughter, told me that she positively yearns for winter to come. The winds and ice will beat the Red-Ships back to their own shores for a bit, and give us a rest from fear, she says. But then Kelty up and says that maybe we'll be able to stop fearing more Forging, but that we'll still have to fear the Forged folk that are loose in our land. Rumor says that some from Forge have left there, now that there's nothing left for them to steal, and that they travel about as bandits, robbing travelers.\n\nI doubt it. More than likely it's other folk doing the robbing, but trying to pass themselves off as Forged folk to send revenge looking elsewhere. Forged folk don't have enough kinship left in them to be a band of anything, I contradicted her lazily. I was looking out across the bay, my eyes almost closed against the glare of the sun on the water. I didn't have to look at Molly to feel her there beside me. It was an interesting tension, one I didn't fully understand. She was sixteen, and I about fourteen, and those two years loomed between us like an insurmountable wall. Yet she always made time for me and seemed to enjoy my company. She seemed as aware of me as I was of her. But if I quested toward her at all, she would draw back, halting to shake a pebble from her shoe or suddenly speaking of her father's illness and how much he needed her. Yet if I drew my sensings back from that tension, she became uncertain and shyer of speech, and would try to look at my face and the set of my mouth and eyes. I didn't understand it, but it was as if we held a string taut between us. But now I heard an edge of annoyance in her speech.\n\nOh, I see. And you know so much of Forged folk, do you, more than those who have been robbed by them?\n\nHer tart words caught me off balance and it was a moment or two before I could speak. Molly knew nothing of Chade and me, let alone of my side trip with him to Forge. To her, I was an errand boy for the keep, working for the stablemaster when I wasn't fetching for the scribe. I couldn't betray my firsthand knowledge, let alone how I had sensed what Forging was.\n\nI've heard the talk of the guards, when they're around the stables and kitchens at night. Soldiers like them have seen much of all kinds of folk, and they're the ones who say that the Forged ones have no friendships, no family, no kinship ties at all left. Still, I suppose if one of them took to robbing travelers, others would copy him, and it would be almost the same as a band of robbers.\n\nPerhaps. She seemed mollified by my comments. Look, let's climb up there to eat.\n\nUp there was a shelf on the cliff's edge rather than the breakwater. But I assented with a nod, and the next handful of minutes were spent in getting ourselves and our basket up there. It required more arduous climbing than our earlier expeditions had. I caught myself watching to see how Molly would manage her skirts, and taking opportunities to catch at her arm to balance her, or take her hand to help her up a steep bit while she kept hold of the basket. In a flash of insight I knew that Molly's suggestion that we climb had been her way of manipulating the situation to cause this. We finally gained the ledge and sat, looking out over the water with her basket between us, and I was savoring my awareness of her awareness of me. It reminded me of the clubs of the Springfest jugglers as they handed them back and forth, back and forth, more and more and faster and faster. The silence lasted until a time when one of us had to speak. I looked at her, but she looked aside. She looked into the basket and said, Oh, dandelion wine? I thought that wasn't any good until after midwinter.", "characters": [{"name": "Fitz", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Chade", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Burrich", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Molly", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Shrewd", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Regal", "role": "ANTAGONIST"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.043}}
{"story_id": "magician_scene_003", "text": "Dolgan puffed on his pipe, a friendly smile splitting his beard. \u201cAnd how do you intend to stop me, Your Grace? Surely not by force?\u201d\n\nBorric shook his head. \u201cNo, of course not. But to go would be the sheerest folly.\u201d\n\nKulgan and Arutha exchanged questioning looks. Pug paid little attention, being lost in a cold, numb world. In spite of having just awakened, he felt ready for sleep again, welcoming its warm, soft relief.\n\nBorric told them, \u201cThis mad dwarf means to return to the mines.\u201d\n\nBefore Kulgan and Arutha could voice a protest, Dolgan said, \u201cI know it is only a slim hope, but if the boy has eluded the foul spirit, he\u2019ll be wandering lost and alone. There are tunnels down there that have never known the tread of a dwarf\u2019s foot, let alone a boy\u2019s. Once down a passage, I have no trouble making my way back, but Tomas has no such natural sense. If I can find his trail, I can find him. If he is to have any chance of escaping the mines, he\u2019ll be needing my guidance. I\u2019ll bring home the boy if he lives, on this you have the word of Dolgan Tagarson, chief of village Caldara. I could not rest in my long hall this winter if I did not try.\u201d\n\nPug was roused from his lethargy by the dwarf\u2019s words. \u201cDo you think you can find him, Dolgan?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf any can, I can,\u201d he said. He leaned close to Pug. \u201cDo not get your hopes too high, for it is unlikely that Tomas eluded the wraith. I would do you a disservice if I said otherwise, boy.\u201d Seeing the tears brimming in Pug\u2019s eyes again, he quickly added, \u201cBut if there is a way, I shall find it.\u201d\n\nPug nodded, seeking a middle path between desolation and renewed hope. He understood the admonition, but still could not give up the faint flicker of comfort Dolgan\u2019s undertaking would provide.\n\nDolgan crossed over to where his shield and ax lay and picked them up. \u201cWhen the dawn comes, quickly follow the trail down the hills through the woodlands. While not the Green Heart, this place has menace aplenty for so small a band. If you lose your way, head due east. You\u2019ll find your way to the road to Bordon. From there it is a matter of three days\u2019 walk. May the gods protect you.\u201d\n\nBorric nodded, and Kulgan walked over to where the dwarf made ready to leave. He handed Dolgan a pouch. \u201cI can get more tabac in the town, friend dwarf. Please take this.\u201d\n\nDolgan took it and smiled at Kulgan. \u201cThank you, magician. I am in your debt.\u201d\n\nBorric came to stand before the dwarf and place a hand on his shoulder. \u201cIt is we who are in your debt, Dolgan. If you come to Crydee, we will have that meal you were promised. That, and more. May good fortune go with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you, Your Lordship. I\u2019ll look forward to it.\u201d Without another word, Dolgan walked into the blackness of Mac Mordain Cadal.\n\nDolgan stopped by the dead mules, pausing only long enough to pick up food, water, and a lantern. The dwarf needed no light to make his way underground\u2014his people had long ago adapted other senses for the darkness. But, he thought, it will increase the chances of finding Tomas if the boy can see the light, no matter the risk of attracting unwelcome attention. Assuming he is still alive, he added grimly.\n\nEntering the tunnel where he had last seen Tomas, Dolgan searched about for signs of the boy\u2019s passing. The dust was thin, but here and there he could make out a slight disturbance, perhaps a footprint. Following, the dwarf came to even dustier passages, where the boy\u2019s footfalls were clearly marked. Hurrying, he followed them.\n\nDolgan came back to the same cavern, after a few minutes, and cursed.\n\nHe felt little hope of finding the boy\u2019s tracks again among all the disturbance caused by the fight with the wraith. Pausing briefly, he set out to examine each tunnel leading out of the cavern for signs. After an hour he found a single footprint heading away from the cavern, through a tunnel to the right of where he had entered the first time. Moving up it, he found several more prints, set wide apart, and decided the boy must have been running. Hurrying on, he saw more tracks, as the passage became dustier.\n\nDolgan came to the cavern on the lake and nearly lost the trail again, until he saw the tunnel near the edge of the landing. He slogged through the water, pulling himself up into the passage, and saw Tomas\u2019s tracks. His faint lantern light was insufficient to illuminate the crystals in the cavern. But even if it had, he would not have paused to admire the sight, so intent was he on finding the boy.\n\nDownward he followed, never resting. He knew that Tomas had long before outdistanced the wraith. There were signs that most of his journey was at a slower pace: footprints in the dust showed he had been walking, and the cold campfire showed he had stopped. But there were other terrors besides the wraith down here, just as dreadful.\n\nDolgan again lost the trail in the last cavern, finding it only when he spied the ledge above where the tracks ended. He had difficulty climbing to it, but when he did, he saw the blackened spot where the boy had snuffed out his torch. Here Tomas must have rested. Dolgan looked around the empty cavern. The air did not move this deep below the mountains. Even the dwarf, who was used to such things, found this an unnerving place. He looked down at the black mark on the ledge. But how long did Tomas stay, and where did he go?\n\nDolgan saw the hole in the wall and, since no tracks led away from the ledge, decided that was the way Tomas must have gone. He climbed through and followed the passage until it came to a larger one, heading downward, into the bowels of the mountain.\n\nDolgan followed what seemed to be a group of tracks, as if a band of men had come this way. Tomas\u2019s tracks were mixed in, and he was worried, for the boy could have been along this way before or after the others, or could have been with them. If the boy was held prisoner by someone, then Dolgan knew every moment was critical.\n\nThe tunnel wound downward and soon changed into a hall fashioned from great stone blocks fitted closely together and polished smooth. In all his years he had never seen its like. The passage leveled out, and Dolgan walked along quietly. The tracks had vanished, for the stone was hard and free of dust. High overhead, Dolgan could make out the first of several crystal chandeliers hung from the ceiling by chains. They could be lowered by means of a pulley, so the candles might be lit. The sound of his boots echoed hollowly off the high ceiling.\n\nAt the far end of the passage he spied large doors, fashioned from wood, with bands of iron and a great lock. They were ajar, and light could be seen coming through.\n\nWithout a sound, Dolgan crept close to the doors and peered in. He gaped at what he saw, his shield and ax coming up instinctively.\n\nSitting on a pile of gold coins, and gems the size of a man\u2019s fist, was Tomas, eating what looked to be a fish. Opposite him crouched a figure that caused Dolgan to doubt his eyes.\n\nA head the size of a small wagon rested on the floor. Shield-size scales of a deep golden color covered it, and the long, supple neck led back to a huge body extending into the gloom of the giant hall. Enormous wings were folded across its back, their drooping tips touching the floor. Two pointed ears sat atop its head, separated by a delicate-looking crest, flecked with silver. Its long muzzle was set in a wolflike grin, showing fangs as long as broadswords, and a long forked tongue flicked out for a moment.\n\nDolgan fought down the overwhelming and rare urge to run, for Tomas was sitting, and to all appearances sharing a meal, with the dwarven folk\u2019s most feared hereditary enemy: a great dragon. He stepped forward, and his boots clacked on the stone floor.\n\nTomas turned at the sound, and the dragon\u2019s great head came up. Giant ruby eyes regarded the small intruder. Tomas jumped to his feet, an expression of joy upon his face. \u201cDolgan!\u201d He scrambled down from the pile of wealth and rushed to the dwarf.\n\nThe dragon\u2019s voice rumbled through the great hall, echoing like thunder through a valley. \u201cWelcome, dwarf. Thy friend hath told me that thou wouldst not forsake him.\u201d\n\nTomas stood before the dwarf, asking a dozen questions, while Dolgan\u2019s senses reeled. Behind the boy, the Prince of all dragons sat quietly observing the exchange, and the dwarf was having trouble maintaining the equanimity that was normally his. Making little sense of Tomas\u2019s questions, Dolgan gently pushed him to one side to better see the dragon. \u201cI came alone,\u201d he said softly to the boy. \u201cThe others were loath to leave the search to me, but they had to press on, so vital was the mission.\u201d\n\nTomas said, \u201cI understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat manner of wizardry is this?\u201d asked Dolgan softly.\n\nThe dragon chuckled, and the room rumbled with the sound. \u201cCome into my home, dwarf, and I will tell thee.\u201d The great dragon\u2019s head returned to the floor, his eyes still resting above Dolgan\u2019s head. The dwarf approached slowly, shield and ax unconsciously at the ready. The dragon laughed, a deep, echoing sound, like water cascading down a canyon. \u201cStay thy hand, small warrior, I\u2019ll not harm thee or thy friend.\u201d\n\nDolgan let his shield down and hung his ax on his belt. He looked around and saw that they were standing in a vast hall, fashioned out of the living rock of the mountain. On all its walls could be seen large tapestries and banners, faded and torn; something about their look set Dolgan\u2019s teeth on edge, for they were as alien as they were ancient\u2014no creature he knew of, human, elf, or goblin fashioned those pennants. More of the giant crystal chandeliers hung from timbers across the ceiling. At the far end of the hall, a throne could be seen on a dais, and long tables with chairs for many diners stood before it. Upon the tables were flagons of crystal and plates of gold. And all was covered with the dust of ages.\n\nElsewhere in the hall lay piles of wealth: gold, gems, crowns, silver, rich armor, bolts of rare cloth, and carved chests of precious woods, fitted with inlaid enamels of great craft.\n\nDolgan sat upon a lifetime\u2019s riches of gold, absently moving it around to make as comfortable a seat as was possible. Tomas sat next to him as the dwarf pulled out his pipe. He didn\u2019t show it, but he felt the need to calm himself, and his pipe always soothed his nerves. He lit a taper from his lantern and struck it to his pipe. The dragon watched him, then said, \u201cCanst thou now breathe fire and smoke, dwarf? Art thou the new dragon? Hath ever a dragon been so small?\u201d\n\nDolgan shook his head. \u201c\u2019Tis but my pipe.\u201d He explained the use of tabac.\n\nThe dragon said, \u201cThis is a strange thing, but thine are a strange folk, in truth.\u201d\n\nDolgan cocked a brow at this but said nothing. \u201cTomas, how did you come to this place?\u201d\n\nTomas seemed unmindful of the dragon, and Dolgan found this reassuring. If the great beast had wished to harm them, he could have done so with little effort. Dragons were undisputedly the mightiest creatures on Midkemia. And this was the mightiest dragon Dolgan had heard of, half again the size of those he had fought in his youth.\n\nTomas finished the fish he had been eating and said, \u201cI wandered for a long time and came to a place where I could sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cAye, I found it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI awoke at the sound of something and found tracks that led here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThose I saw also. I was afraid you had been taken.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wasn\u2019t. It was a party of goblins and a few Dark Brothers, coming to this place. They were very concerned about what was ahead and didn\u2019t pay attention to what was behind, so I could follow fairly close.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was a dangerous thing to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, but I was desperate for a way out. I thought they might lead me to the surface, and I could wait while they went on ahead, then slip out. If I could get out of the mines, I could have headed north toward your village.\u201d\n\n\u201cA bold plan, Tomas,\u201d said Dolgan, an approving look in his eyes.\n\n\u201cThey came to this place, and I followed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened to them?\u201d\n\nThe dragon spoke. \u201cI sent them far away, dwarf, for they were not company I would choose.\u201d\n\n\u201cSent them away?

{"story_id": "red_rising_scene_004", "text": "13\n\n\n\n\n\nBAD THINGS\n\n\nMatteo is a tall wisp of a Pink with long limbs and a lean, beautiful face. He is a slave. Or was a slave for carnal pleasures. Yet he walks like a water lord. Beauty in his step. Manners and grace in the wave of his hand. He has a penchant for wearing gloves and sniffing at even the smallest bit of dirt. Body maintenance has been his life\u2019s purpose. So he doesn\u2019t find it strange when he helps me apply a hair follicle killer to my arms, legs, torso, and privates. But I do. When we\u2019re done, we\u2019re both cursing\u2014me from the sting, him from the punch I threw at his shoulder. I accidentally dislocated it just by punching it. I still don\u2019t know my own strength. And they do make their Pinks fragile. If he is the rose, I am the thorns.\n\n\u201cBald as a toddler, you frenetic little baby,\u201d Matteo sighs as properly as one can say such a thing. \u201cJust as the newest Luna fashion requires. Now, with a bit of eyebrow sculpting\u2014oh, how your brows are like fungus-nibbling caterpillars\u2014and nose-hair eradication, cuticle readjustment, teeth whitening on those slick new chompers\u2014which, if I may say, are yellow as mustard dappled with dandelions \u2026 tell me, have you ever brushed your new teeth?\u2014and blackhead removal (which shall be like probing for helium-3), toner adjustment, and melatonin injections, and you\u2019ll be prim and rose proper\u2013ish.\u201d\n\nI snort at the foolishness of it all. \u201cI already look like a Gold.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou look like a Bronze! A fool\u2019s Gold! One of the lowbred bastards who looks more khaki than Gold. You must be perfect.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a bloodydamn odd lark, Matteo.\u201d\n\nHe smacks me. \u201cMind yourself! A Gold would rather die than use that slithering mineslang. \u2018Gorydamn\u2019 or \u2018gory\u2019; and \u2018slag\u2019 instead of \u2018squab.\u2019 Every time you say \u2018bloody\u2019 or \u2018bloodydamn,\u2019 I will smack not your gob, but your mouth. And if you say \u2018squab\u2019 or \u2018gob,\u2019 I will kick you in the scrotum\u2014which I do know my way around\u2014as I will do if you do not get rid of that horrible accent. You sound like you were born in a gorydamn dumpster.\u201d\n\nHe frowns and sets his hands on his narrow hips.\n\n\u201cAnd then we\u2019ll have to teach you manners. And culture, culture, goodman.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have manners.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the maker, we are so, so going to have to make you forswear that brogue as well as the cursing.\u201d\n\nHe pokes me as he lists out my flaws.\n\n\u201cMight try adopting some manners of your own, buttboy,\u201d I growl.\n\nHe pulls off one of my gloves and slaps me across the face and takes a bottle in hand and holds it to my throat. I laugh.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll have to get your Helldiver reflexes back soon to go with that gawky new body.\u201d\n\nI eye the bottle.\n\n\u201cGoing to poke me to death?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a polyenne sword, goodman. A razor, in other words. One moment it is soft as hair, but with an organic impulse, it turns harder than diamond. It is the only thing that will cut through a pulseShield. One moment a whip, the next moment a perfect sword. It is the weapon of a gentleman. A Gold. For any other Color to carry it is death.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is a bottle, you daft\u2014\u201d\n\nHe jams me in the throat so that I gag.\n\n\u201cAnd it was your manners that forced me to draw my razor and challenge you, thereby precipitously ending your impudent life. You may have fought with fists for honor in that hovel you called home. You were a bug then. An ant. An Aureate fights with a blade at the slightest provocation. They have honor the likes of which you know nothing about. Your honor was personal; theirs is personal, familial, and planetary. That is all. They fight for higher stakes, and they do not forgive when the bloodletting is done. Least of all the Peerless Scarred. Manners, goodman. Manners will protect you until you can protect yourself from my shampoo bottle.\u201d\n\n\u201cMatteo \u2026,\u201d I say, rubbing my throat.\n\n\u201cYes?\u201d he sighs.\n\n\u201cWhat is shampoo?\u201d\n\nAnother stint in Mickey\u2019s carving room might have been preferable to Matteo\u2019s tutelage. At least Mickey was afraid of me.\n\n\nThe next morning Dancer tries to rename me.\n\n\u201cYou will be the son of a relatively unknown family from the far asteroid clusters. Soon, the family will be dead in a shipping accident. You will be the lone survivor and the only heir to their debts and poor status. His name, your name, will be Caius au Andromedus.\u201d\n\n\u201cSlag that,\u201d I reply. \u201cI will be Darrow or I will be nothing.\u201d\n\nHe scratches his head. \u201cDarrow is an \u2026 odd name.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have made me give up the hair Father gave me, the eyes Mother left me, the Color I was born to, so I will keep the name they granted me, and you can make it work.\u201d\n\n\u201cI liked it better when you didn\u2019t act like a Gold,\u201d Dancer grumbles.\n\n\n\u201cNow, the key to dining like an Aureate is to eat slowly,\u201d Matteo says as we sit together at a table in the penthouse where Dancer first showed me the world. \u201cYou will find yourself subjected to many Trimalchian feasts. On such occasions, there will be seven courses\u2014appetizer, soup, fish, meat, salad, dessert, and libations.\u201d\n\nHe gestures to a small tray laden with silverware and explains the various methods for eating with each.\n\nThen he tells me, \u201cIf you must urinate or defecate during the meal, you hold it in. Controlling one\u2019s bodily functions is expected of an Aureate.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo these namby-pamby Goldbrows aren\u2019t allowed to shit? And when they do, I wonder, does it come out gold?\u201d\n\nMatteo slaps my cheek with his glove. \u201cIf you\u2019re so eager to see red again, let your tongue slip in their presence, goodman, and they\u2019ll be happy to remind you what color all men bleed. Manners and control! You have neither.\u201d He shakes his head. \u201cNow, tell me what this fork is used for.\u201d\n\nI want to tell him it\u2019s used for picking his arse, but I sigh and give him the correct answer. \u201cFish, but only if the bones are still in the dish.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how much of this fish are you to eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of it,\u201d I guess.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d he cries. \u201cWere you even listening?\u201d His small hands clutch his hair and he takes a deep breath. \u201cMust I remind you? There are Bronzies. There are Golds. And there are Pixies.\u201d\n\nHe leaves the rest for me to finish.\n\n\u201cPixies have no self-control,\u201d I remember aloud. \u201cThey take in all the treats of power, but do pissall to merit them. They are born and they chase pleasure. Righto?\u201d\n\n\u201cPrime, not righto. Now what is expected of a Gold? Of a Peerless Scarred?\u201d\n\n\u201cPerfection.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich means?\u201d\n\nMy voice is cold as I mimic a Gold\u2019s accent. \u201cIt means control, goodman. Self-control. I am permitted to indulge in vices so long as I never permit them to usurp control. If there is a key to understanding Aureates, it is found in understanding control in all its forms. Eat the fish, leave twenty percent to indicate its deliciousness did not overpower my resolve or make slaves of my taste-buds.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you were listening after all.\u201d\n\nDancer finds me the next day as I practice my Aureate accent in the penthouse\u2019s holomirror. I can see a three-dimensional depiction of my head in front of me. The teeth move strangely, catching my tongue as I try to roll my words. I am still becoming used to my body, even months after the last of the surgeries. My teeth are larger than I initially thought them. It also doesn\u2019t help that the Goldbrows speak as though they\u2019ve had golden shovels stuck up their bloodydamn stinkholes. So I find it easier to speak like one if I see that I am one. The arrogance comes easier.\n\n\u201cSoften your r\u2019s,\u201d Dancer tells me. He sits attentively as I read from a datapad. \u201cPretend as though there is an h in front of each one.\u201d His burner reminds me of home and I remember how ArchGovernor Augustus seemed in Lykos. I remember the man\u2019s serenity. His patient condescension. His smirk. \u201cElongate the l\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that all the strength you have?\u201d I say into the mirror.\n\n\u201cPerfect,\u201d Dancer praises with a humorous shiver. He claps his good hand on his knee.\n\n\u201cSoon I\u2019ll be dreaming like I\u2019m a bloodydamn Goldbrow too,\u201d I say in disgust.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t say \u2018bloodydamn.\u2019 Say \u2018gory\u2019 or \u2018gorydamn\u2019 instead.\u201d", "characters": [{"name": "Darrow", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Matteo", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Dancer", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Mickey", "role": "MINOR"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0362}}
{"story_id": "dune_scene_005", "text": "Hawat pulled up a chair across from Paul, sat down facing the door. He did it pointedly, leaned back and studied the room. It struck him as an odd place suddenly, a stranger-place with most of its hardware already gone off to Arrakis. A training table remained, and a fencing mirror with its crystal prisms quiescent, the target dummy beside it patched and padded, looking like an ancient foot soldier maimed and battered in the wars.\n\n\t\tThere stand I, Hawat thought.\n\n\t\t\u201cThufir, what\u2019re you thinking?\u201d Paul asked.\n\n\t\tHawat looked at the boy. \u201cI was thinking we\u2019ll all be out of here soon and likely never see the place again.\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cDoes that make you sad?\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cSad? Nonsense! Parting with friends is a sadness. A place is only a place.\u201d He glanced at the charts on the table. \u201cAnd Arrakis is just another place.\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cDid my father send you up to test me?\u201d\n\n\t\tHawat scowled\u2014the boy had such observing ways about him. He nodded. \u201cYou\u2019re thinking it\u2019d have been nicer if he\u2019d come up himself, but you must know how busy he is. He\u2019ll be along later.\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cI\u2019ve been studying about the storms on Arrakis.\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cThe storms. I see.\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cThey sound pretty bad.\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cThat\u2019s too cautious a word: bad. Those storms build up across six or seven thousand kilometers of flatlands, feed on anything that can give them a push\u2014coriolis force, other storms, anything that has an ounce of energy in it. They can blow up to seven hundred kilometers an hour, loaded with everything loose that\u2019s in their way\u2014sand, dust, everything. They can eat flesh off bones and etch the bones to slivers.\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cWhy don\u2019t they have weather control?\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cArrakis has special problems, costs are higher, and there\u2019d be maintenance and the like. The Guild wants a dreadful high price for satellite control and your father\u2019s House isn\u2019t one of the big rich ones, lad. You know that.\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cHave you ever seen the Fremen?\u201d\n\n\t\tThe lad\u2019s mind is darting all over today, Hawat thought.\n\n\t\t\u201cLike as not I have seen them,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s little to tell them from the folk of the graben and sink. They all wear those great flowing robes. And they stink to heaven in any closed space. It\u2019s from those suits they wear\u2014call them \u2018stillsuits\u2019\u2014that reclaim the body\u2019s own water.\u201d\n\n\t\tPaul swallowed, suddenly aware of the moisture in his mouth, remembering a dream of thirst. That people could want so for water they had to recycle their body moisture struck him with a feeling of desolation. \u201cWater\u2019s precious there,\u201d he said.\n\n\t\tHawat nodded, thinking: Perhaps I\u2019m doing it, getting across to him the importance of this planet as an enemy. It\u2019s madness to go in there without that caution in our minds.\n\n\t\tPaul looked up at the skylight, aware that it had begun to rain. He saw the spreading wetness on the gray meta-glass. \u201cWater,\u201d he said.\n\n\t\t\u201cYou\u2019ll learn a great concern for water,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cAs the Duke\u2019s son you\u2019ll never want for it, but you\u2019ll see the pressures of thirst all around you.\u201d\n\n\t\tPaul wet his lips with his tongue, thinking back to the day a week ago and the ordeal with the Reverend Mother. She, too, had said something about water starvation.\n\n\t\t\u201cYou\u2019ll learn about the funeral plains,\u201d she\u2019d said, \u201cabout the wilderness that is empty, the wasteland where nothing lives except the spice and the sandworms. You\u2019ll stain your eyepits to reduce the sun glare. Shelter will mean a hollow out of the wind and hidden from view. You\u2019ll ride upon your own two feet without \u2019thopter or groundcar or mount.\u201d\n\n\t\tAnd Paul had been caught more by her tone\u2014singsong and wavering\u2014than by her words.\n\n\t\t\u201cWhen you live upon Arrakis,\u201d she had said, \u201ckhala, the land is empty. The moons will be your friends, the sun your enemy.\u201d\n\n\t\tPaul had sensed his mother come up beside him away from her post guarding the door. She had looked at the Reverend Mother and asked: \u201cDo you see no hope, Your Reverence?\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cNot for the father.\u201d And the old woman had waved Jessica to silence, looked down at Paul. \u201cGrave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four things\u2026.\u201d She held up four big-knuckled fingers. \u201c\u2026the learning of the wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of the brave. But all of these are as nothing\u2026.\u201d She closed her fingers into a fist. \u201c\u2026without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science of your tradition!\u201d\n\n\t\tA week had passed since that day with the Reverend Mother. Her words were only now beginning to come into full register. Now, sitting in the training room with Thufir Hawat, Paul felt a sharp pang of fear. He looked across at the Mentat\u2019s puzzled frown.\n\n\t\t\u201cWhere were you woolgathering that time?\u201d Hawat asked.\n\n\t\t\u201cDid you meet the Reverend Mother?\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cThat Truthsayer witch from the Imperium?\u201d Hawat\u2019s eyes quickened with interest. \u201cI met her.\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cShe\u2026.\u201d Paul hesitated, found that he couldn\u2019t tell Hawat about the ordeal. The inhibitions went deep.\n\n\t\t\u201cYes? What did she?\u201d\n\n\t\tPaul took two deep breaths. \u201cShe said a thing.\u201d He closed his eyes, calling up the words, and when he spoke his voice unconsciously took on some of the old woman\u2019s tone: \u201c\u2018You, Paul Atreides, descendant of kings, son of a Duke, you must learn to rule. It\u2019s something none of your ancestors learned.\u2019\u201d Paul opened his eyes, said: \u201cThat made me angry and I said my father rules an entire planet. And she said, \u2018He\u2019s losing it.\u2019 And I said my father was getting a richer planet. And she said, \u2018He\u2019ll lose that one, too.\u2019 And I wanted to run and warn my father, but she said he\u2019d already been warned\u2014by you, by Mother, by many people.\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cTrue enough,\u201d Hawat muttered.\n\n\t\t\u201cThen why\u2019re we going?\u201d Paul demanded.\n\n\t\t\u201cBecause the Emperor ordered it. And because there\u2019s hope in spite of what that witch-spy said. What else spouted from this ancient fountain of wisdom?\u201d\n\n\t\tPaul looked down at his right hand clenched into a fist beneath the table. Slowly, he willed the muscles to relax. She put some kind of hold on me, he thought. How?\n\n\t\t\u201cShe asked me to tell her what it is to rule,\u201d Paul said. \u201cAnd I said that one commands. And she said I had some unlearning to do.\u201d\n\n\t\tShe hit a mark there right enough, Hawat thought. He nodded for Paul to continue.\n\n\t\t\u201cShe said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel. She said he must lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men.\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cHow\u2019d she figure your father attracted men like Duncan and Gurney?\u201d Hawat asked.\n\n\t\tPaul shrugged. \u201cThen she said a good ruler has to learn his world\u2019s language, that it\u2019s different for every world. And I thought she meant they didn\u2019t speak Galach on Arrakis, but she said that wasn\u2019t it at all. She said she meant the language of the rocks and growing things, the language you don\u2019t hear just with your ears. And I said that\u2019s what Dr. Yueh calls the Mystery of Life.\u201d\n\n\t\tHawat chuckled. \u201cHow\u2019d that sit with her?\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cI think she got mad. She said the mystery of life isn\u2019t a problem to solve, but a reality to experience. So I quoted the First Law of Mentat at her: \u2018A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.\u2019 That seemed to satisfy her.\u201d\n\n\t\tHe seems to be getting over it, Hawat thought, but that old witch frightened him. Why did she do it?\n\n\t\t\u201cThufir,\u201d Paul said, \u201cwill Arrakis be as bad as she said?\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cNothing could be that bad,\u201d Hawat said and forced a smile. \u201cTake those Fremen, for example, the renegade people of the desert. By first-approximation analysis, I can tell you there\u2019re many, many more of them than the Imperium suspects. People live there, lad: a great many people, and\u2026.\u201d Hawat put a sinewy finger beside his eye. \u201c\u2026they hate Harkonnens with a bloody passion. You must not breathe a word of this, lad. I tell you only as your father\u2019s helper.\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cMy father has told me of Salusa Secundus,\u201d Paul said. \u201cDo you know, Thufir, it sounds much like Arrakis\u2026perhaps not quite as bad, but much like it.\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cWe do not really know of Salusa Secundus today,\u201d Hawat said. \u201cOnly what it was like long ago\u2026mostly. But what is known\u2014you\u2019re right on that score.\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cWill the Fremen help us?\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cIt\u2019s a possibility.\u201d Hawat stood up. \u201cI leave today for Arrakis. Meanwhile, you take care of yourself for an old man who\u2019s fond of you, heh? Come around here like the good lad and sit facing the door. It\u2019s not that I think there\u2019s any danger in the castle; it\u2019s just a habit I want you to form.\u201d\n\n\t\tPaul got to his feet, moved around the table. \u201cYou\u2019re going today?\u201d\n\n\t\t\u201cToday it is, and you\u2019ll be following tomorrow. Next time we meet it\u2019ll be on the soil of your new world.\u201d He gripped Paul\u2019s right arm at the bicep. \u201cKeep your knife arm free, heh? And your shield at full charge.\u201d He released the arm, patted Paul\u2019s shoulder, whirled and strode quickly to the door.\n\n\t\t\u201cThufir!\u201d Paul called.\n\n\t\tHawat turned, standing in the open doorway.\n\n\t\t\u201cDon\u2019t sit with your back to any doors,\u201d Paul said.\n\n\t\tA grin spread across the seamed old face. \u201cThat I won\u2019t, lad.

{"story_id": "lies_of_locke_lamora_scene_006", "text": "\"Twelve gods, no\" the man whispered. He licked his lips, stared at Locke for a second or two,and then gave a brief nod. \"What do I do?\"\n\"Just follow me,\" said Locke. \"We'll make this easy and quick.\"\n\"I have about twenty minutes,\" said the waiter. \"And then ] need to be back on the floor\"\n\"When I'm finished,\" said Locke, \"that won't matter. PU let Meraggio know you've helped us both; you'll be off the hook.\"\n \n\"Uh,okay. Where are we going?\"\n\"Just around the corner here... We need an inn.\"\nThe Welcoming Shade was just around the block from Meraggio's Countinghouse. It was tolerably clean, cheap, and devoid of luxuries\u0097the sort of place that hosted couriers, scholars, scribes, attendants, and lesser functionaries rather than the better classes of businessfolk. The place was a two-story square, built around an open central space in the fashion of a Therin Throne villa. At the center of this courtyard was a tall olive tree with leaves that rustled pleasantly in the sunlight.\n\"One room,\" said Locke, \"with a window, just for the day.\" He set coins down on the counter. The innkeeper scurried out, key in hand, to show Locke and the waiter to a second-story room marked \"9.\"\nChamber nine had a pair of folding cots, an oiled-paper window, a small closet, and nothing else. The master of the Welcoming Shade bowed as he left, and kept his mouth shut. Like most Camorri innkeepers, any questions he might have had about his customers or their business tended to vanish when silver hit the counter.\n\"What's your name?\" Locke drew the room's door closed and shot the bolt.\n\"Benjavier,\" said the waiter. \"You're, ah, sure..,this is going to work out like you say it is?\"\nIn response, Locke drew out his coin purse and set it in Benjavier's hand. \"There's two more full crowns in there, above and beyond what you'll receive. Plus quite a bit of gold and silver. My word's as good as my money\u0097and you can keep that purse, here, as an assurance until I return.\"\n\"Gods,\" said Ben Javier. \"This is.., this is all so very odd, I wonder what I've done to deserve such incredible fortune?\"\n\"Most men do nothing to deserve what the gods throw their way,\" said Locke. \"Shall we be about our business?\"\n\"Yes, yes.\" Benjavier untied his apron and tossed it to Locke; he then began to work on his jacket and breeches. Locke slipped off his velvet cap.\n\"[ say, gray hair\u0097you don't look your age, in the face, I mean.\"\n\"I've always been blessed with youthful lines,\" said Locke. \"It's been of some benefit, in the duke's service. I'll need your shoes, as well\u0097mine would look rather out of place beneath that finery.\"\nWorking quickly, the two men removed and traded clothing until Locke stood in the center of the room, fully garbed as a Meraggio's waiter, with the maroon apron tied at his waist. Benjavier lounged on one of the\n \nsleeping pallets in his undertunic and breechclout, tossing the bag of jingling coins from hand to hand.\n\"Well? How do I look?\"\n\"You look right smart,\" said Benjavier. \"You'll blend right in.\"\n\"Good, You, for your part, look right wealthy. Just wait here with the door locked; I'll be back soon enough. I'll knock exactly five times, savvy?\"\n\"Sounds fine.\"\nLocke closed the door behind him, hurried down the stairs, across the courtyard, and back out into the street. He took the long way around to return to Meraggio's, so he could enter via the front and avoid the guard at the service entrance.\n\"You're not supposed to come and go this way\" said the directory guard when Locke burst into the foyer, red-cheeked and sweating.\n\"I know, sorry.\" Locke waved his blank roll of parchment at the man. \"I was sent out to fetch this for one of the lawscribes; one of the private gallery members, I should say,\"\n\"Oh,sorry. Don't let us keep you; go right through.\"\nLocke entered into the crowd on the floor of Meraggio's for the third time, gratified by how few lingering looks he received as he hurried on his way. He wove deftly between well-dressed men and women and ducked out of the path of waiters bearing covered silver trays\u0097he was careful to give these men a friendly, familiar nod as they passed. In moments, he found what he was looking for\u0097two guards lounging against a back wall, their heads bent together in conversation.\n\"Look lively, gentlemen,\" said Locke as he stepped up before them; either one of them had to outweigh him by at least five stone. \"Either of you lads know a man named Benjavier? He's one of my fellow waiters.\"\n\"I know him by sight\" said one of the guards.\n\"He's in a heap of shit,\" said Locke. \"He's over at the Welcoming Shade, and he's just fucked up one of Meraggio's tests. I'm to fetch him back; I'm supposed to grab you two for help.\"\n\"One of Meraggio's tests?\"\n\"You know,\" said Locke. \"Like he did to Willa\"\n\"Oh, her. That clerk in the public section. Benjavier, you say? What's he done?\"\n\"Sold the old man out, and Meraggio's not pleased. We really should do this sooner rather than later\"\n\"Uh... sure, sure.\"\n\"Out the side, through the service entrance.1\"\n \nLocke positioned himself very carefully to make it seem as though he was confidently walking along beside the guards when in fact he was following their lead through the kitchens, the service corridors, and finally the receiving room. He slipped into the lead, and the two guards were on his heels as he stepped out into the alley, waving casually at the lounging guard. The man showed no signs of recognizing him; Locke had seen dozens of waiters already with his own eyes. No doubt a stranger could pass as one for quite some time, and he didn't even need quite some time.\nA few minutes later, he rapped sharply on the door of chamber nine at the Welcoming Shade, five times. Benjavier opened the door a crack, only to have it shoved open all the way by a stiff arm from Locke, who called up some of the manner he'd used when he'd lectured Don Salvara as a \"Midnighter.\"\n\"It was a loyalty test, Benjavier,\" said Locke as he stalked into the room, his eyes cold, \"A loyalty test, And you fucked it up. Take him and hold him, lads.\"\nThe two guards moved to restrain the half-naked waiter, who stared at them in shock \"But... but I didn't... but you said\u0097w\n\"Your job is to serve Meraggio's customers and sustain Master Meraggio's trust. My job is to find and deal with men that don't sustain his trust. You sold me your gods-damned uniform.\" Locke swept white iron crowns and the coin purse up from the bed; he dropped the loose coins into the leather bag as he spoke.\"I could have been a thief. I could have been an assassin. And you would have let me walk right up to Master Meraggio, with the perfect disguise.\"\n\"But you... oh, gods, you can't be serious, this can't be happening!\"\n\"Do these men look less than serious? I'm sorry, Benjavier. It's nothing personal, but you made a very poor decision.\" Locke held the door open. \"Right, out with him. Back to Meraggio's, quick as you can.\"\nBenjavier kicked out, snarling and crying, \"No, no, you can't, I've been loyal all my\u0097\" Locke grabbed him by the chin and stared into his eyes.\n\"If you fight back,\" said Locke, \"if you kick or scream or continue to raise a gods-damned fuss, this matter will go beyond Meraggio's, do you understand? We will bring in the watch. We will have you hauled to the Palace of Patience in irons. Master Meraggio has many friends at the Palace of Patience. Your case might fall between the cracks for a few months. You might get to sit in a spider cage and ponder your wrongdoing until the rains of winter start to fall. Do ] make myself clear?\"\n\"Yes,\" sobbed Benjavier, \"Oh,gods, I'm sorry, I'm sorry....\"\n \n\"It's not me you need to apologize to. Now, like I said, let's get him back quickly. Master Meraggio's going to want a word with him.\"\nLocke led the way back to the countinghouse, with Benjavier sobbing but quiescent, Locke strolled into the receiving room, right past the startled service-door guard, and bellowed, \"Clear this room. Now?\nA few of the lounging waiters looked as though they might offer argument, but the sight of Benjavier, half-dressed and firmly held by the two guards, seemed to convince them that something was deeply amiss. They scuttled from the room, and Locke turned to the guards.\n\"Hold him here,\" said Locke. 'I'm going to fetch Master Meraggio; we'll return in a few moments, This room is to stay clear until we return. Let the waiters take their ease somewhere else.\"\n\"Hey, what's going on?\" The service-door guard poked his head into the receiving room.\n\"If you value your job,\" said Locke, \"keep your eyes out there in that alley, and don't let anyone else in, Meraggio's going to be down here soon, and he's going to be in a mood, so it'd be best not to catch his attention.\"\n\"I think he's right, Laval,\" said one of the guards holding Benjavier.\n\"Uh.. .sure, sure.\"The service-door guard vanished.\n\"As for you,\" said Locke, stepping close to Benjavier, \"like I said, it's nothing personal. Can ] give you a bit of advice? Don't play games. You can't lie to Meraggio. None of us could, on our best day. Just confess, straight out. Be totally honest. Do you understand?\"\n\"Yes,\" sniffed Benjavier. \"Yes, please, I'll do anything\t\"\n\"You don't need to do anything. But if you hope for Master Meraggio to be at all lenient or sympathetic, then by the gods, you rucking confess and you do it in a hurry. No games, remember?\"\n\"O-okay, yes, anything.. \"\n\"I shall return very shortly,\" said Locke, and he spun on his heel and made for the door. As he left the receiving room, he allowed himself a brief smirk of pleasure; the guards pinning Benjavier now looked almost as frightened of him as the waiter did. It was strange, how readily authority could be conjured with nothing but a bit of strutting jackassery. He made his way through the service passages and kitchens, and back out onto the public floor.\n\"I say,\" said Locke to the first guard he came across, ^is Master Meraggio in the members' galleries?\" Locke waved his blank rolled parchment as though it were pressing business.\n \n\"Far as I know,\" said the guard, \"I think he's up on the third level, taking reports.\"\n\"Many thanks.\"\nLocke climbed the wide black iron stairs that led up to the first members'gallery, nodding at the pair of guards at its base. His uniform seemed to be a sufficient guarantee of gallery privileges, but he kept the parchment clutched visibly in both hands, as an added assurance. He scanned the first-floor galleries, found no sign of his quarry, and continued upward.\nHe found Ciancana Meraggio on the third floor, just as the guard had indicated. Meraggio stood staring out at the public gallery,abstractly, as he listened to a pair of finnickers behind him read from wax tablets figures that meant very little to Locke. Meraggio didn't seem to keep a bodyguard near his person; apparently he felt safe enough within the bounds of his commercial kingdom. So much the better, Locke stepped right up beside him, relishing the arrogance of the gesture, and stood waiting to be noticed.\nThe finnickers and several nearby gallery members started muttering to themselves; after a few seconds Meraggio turned and let the full power of his storm-lantern glare rest on Locke. It took only a moment for that glare to shift from irritation to suspicion.\n\"You\" said Meraggio, \"do nor work for me.\"\n\"I bring greetings from Capa Raza of Camorr\" said Locke, in a quiet and respectful voice. \"I have a very serious matter to bring to your attention, Master Meraggio.\"\nThe master of the countinghouse stared at him, then removed his optics and tucked them in a coat pocket, \"So it's true, then. I'd heard Barsavi\nhad gone the way of all flesh\tAnd now your master sends a lackey. How\nkind of him. What's his business?\"\n\"His business is rather congruent with yours, Master Meraggio. I'm here to save your life.\"\nMeraggio snorted. \"My life is hardly in danger, my improperly dressed friend. This is my house, and any guard here would cut your balls off with two words from me. If I WCTC you, I'd start explaining where you got that uniform.\"\n\"I purchased it,\" said Locke, \"from one of your waiters, a man by the name of Benjavier. I knew he was tractable, because he's already in on the plot against your life.\"\n\"Ben? Gods damn it\u0097what proof have you?\"\n \n\"I have several of your guards holding him down by your service entrance, rather half-dressed.\"\n\"What do you mean you have several of my guards holding him? Who the hell do you think you are?\"\n\"Capa Raza has given me the job of saving your life, Master Meraggio. I mean exactly what I said. And as for who I am, I happen to be your savior.\"\n\"My guards and my waiters\u0097\"\n\"Are not reliable,\" hissed Locke. \"Are you blind? I didn't purchase this at a secondhand clothier; I walked right in through your service entrance, offered a few crowns, and your man Benjavier was out of his uniform like that,\" Locke snapped his fingers, \"Your guard at the service door slipped me in for much less\u0097just a solon. Your men are not made of stone, Master Meraggio; you presume much concerning their fidelity\"\nMeraggio stared at him, color rising in his cheeks; he looked as though he was about to strike Locke. Instead, he coughed and held out his hands, palms up,\n\"Tell me what you came to tell me,\" said Meraggio. \"I'll take my own counsel from there.\"\n\"Your fin nickers are crowding me. Dismiss them and give us a bit of privacy.\"\n\"Don't tell me what to do in my own\u0097\"\n\"I will tell you what to do, gods damn it,\" Locke spat. \"I am youT fucking bodyguardjMister Meraggio. You are in deadly danger; minutes count, You already know of at least one compromised waiter and one lax guard; how much longer are you going to prevent me from keeping you alive?\"\n\"Why is Capa Raza so concerned for my safety?\"\n\"Your personal comfort likely means nothing to him,\" said Locke. \"The safety of the Meraggio, however, is of paramount importance. An assassination contract has been taken out against you, by Verrari commercial interests who wish to see Camorr's fortunes diminished. Raza has been in power for four days; your assassination would shake the city to its foundations. The Spider and the city watch would tear Raza's people apart looking for answers, He simply cannot allow harm to come to you. He must keep this city stable, as surely as the duke must.\"\n\"And how does your master know all of this?\"\n\"A gift from the gods,\" said Locke. \"Letters were intercepted while my master's agents were pursuing an unrelated matter. Please dismiss your finnickers,\"\n \nMeraggio pondered for a few seconds, then grunted and waved his attendants away with an irritated wrist-flick. They backed off, wide-eyed.\n\"Someone very nasty is after you,\" said Locke. \"It's a crossbow job; the assassin is Lashani. Supposedly, his weapons have been altered by a Karthani Bondsmage. He's slippery as all hell, and he almost always hits the mark. Be flattered; we believe his fee is ten thousand crowns.\"\n\"This is a great deal to swallow, Master,..\"\n\"My name isn't important\" said Locke. \"Come with me, down to the receiving room behind the kitchens. You can talk to Benjavier yourself.\"\n\"The receiving room, behind the kitchens?\" Meraggio frowned deeply. \"As yet, I have no reason to believe that you yourself might not be trying to Jure me there for mischief,\"\n\"Master Meraggio,\" said Locke, \"you are wearing silk and cotton, not chain mail. I have had you at dagger-reach for several minutes now. If my master wished you dead, your entrails would be staining the carpet. You don't have to thank me\u0097you don't even have to like me\u0097but for the love of the gods, please accept that I have been ordered to guard you, and one does not refuse the orders of the Capa of Camorr.\"\n\"Hmmm. A point. Is he as formidable a man as Barsavi was, this Capa Raza?\"\n\"Barsavi died weeping at his feet,\" said Locke. \"Barsavi and all of his children. Draw your own conclusions.\"\nMeraggio slipped his optics back onto his nose, adjusted his orchid, and put his hands behind his back.\n\"We shall go to the receiving room,\" he said. \"You lead the way.\"", "characters": [{"name": "Locke", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Benjavier", "role": "MINOR"}, {"name": "Meraggio", "role": "ANTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Laval", "role": "MINOR"}, {"name": "Capa Raza", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0422}}
{"story_id": "the_fifth_season_scene_007", "text": "\u201cThat\u2019s a shame.\u201d And then, because Syenite is beginning to understand why Alabaster is such an ass about this, she folds her hands. \u201cUnfortunately, it wasn\u2019t a request. Do you have a telegraph here? I\u2019d like to send a message to the Fulcrum, let them know we\u2019ll be delayed.\u201d\n\nAsael\u2019s eyes narrow, because of course they have a telegraph, and of course Syenite meant that as another dig. \u201cDelayed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, yes.\u201d Syen raises her eyebrows. She knows she\u2019s not doing a good job of looking innocent, but she tries, at least. \u201cHow long do you think it will be before the governor is able to meet with us? The Fulcrum will want to know.\u201d And she stands, as if to leave.\n\nAsael tilts her head, but Syenite can see the tension in her shoulders. \u201cI thought you were more reasonable than your colleague. You\u2019re actually going to walk out of here, and not clear our harbor, in a fit of pique.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t a fit of pique.\u201d Now Syen\u2019s mad for real. Now she gets it. She looks down at Asael, who sits there, smug and secure in her big chair behind her big desk, and it\u2019s an actual fight to keep her fists from clenching, her jaw muscles from flexing. \u201cWould you tolerate this treatment, in our position?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I would!\u201d Asael straightens, surprised into an actual reaction for once. \u201cThe governor has no time for\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you wouldn\u2019t tolerate it. Because if you were in my position, you\u2019d be the representative of an independent and powerful organization, not some two-quartz backwater flunky. You would expect to be treated like a skilled expert who\u2019s been learning her craft since childhood. Like someone who plies an important and difficult trade, and who\u2019s come to perform a task that dictates your comm\u2019s livelihood.\u201d\n\nAsael is staring at her. Syenite pauses, takes a deep breath. She must stay polite, and wield that politeness like a finely knapped glassknife. She must be cold and calm in her anger, lest a lack of self-control be dismissed as the mark of monstrosity. Once the heat behind her eyes has eased, she steps forward.\n\n\u201cAnd yet you haven\u2019t shaken our hands, Asael Leader. You didn\u2019t look us in the eye when we first met. You still haven\u2019t offered that cup of safe that Alabaster suggested yesterday. Would you do that to a decreed \u2019mest from the Seventh University? Would you do it to a master geneer, come to repair the comm\u2019s hydro? Would you do it to a representative of the Strongbacks\u2019 Union for your own comm?\u201d\n\nAsael actually flinches as the analogies finally get through to her. Syenite waits in silence, letting it gather pressure. Finally Asael says, \u201cI see.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe you do.\u201d She keeps waiting, and Asael sighs.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want? An apology? Then I apologize. You must remember, though, that most normal people have never seen an orogene, let alone had to do business with one, and\u2014\u201d She spreads her hands. \u201cIsn\u2019t it understandable that we might be\u2026 uncomfortable?\u201d\n\n\u201cDiscomfort is understandable. It\u2019s the rudeness that isn\u2019t.\u201d Rust this. This woman doesn\u2019t deserve the effort of her explanation. Syen decides to save that for someone who matters. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a really shitty apology. \u2018I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re so abnormal that I can\u2019t manage to treat you like a human being.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a rogga,\u201d Asael snaps, and then has the gall to look surprised at herself.\n\n\u201cWell.\u201d Syenite makes herself smile. \u201cAt least that\u2019s out in the open.\u201d She shakes her head and turns toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ll come back tomorrow. Maybe you\u2019ll have had time to check the governor\u2019s schedule by then.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are under contract,\u201d Asael says, her voice tight enough to quaver. \u201cYou are required to perform the service for which we have paid your organization.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we will.\u201d Syenite reaches the door and stops with her hand on the handle, shrugging. \u201cBut the contract doesn\u2019t specify how long we have, upon arrival, to get it done.\u201d She\u2019s bluffing. She has no idea what\u2019s in the contract. But she\u2019s willing to bet Asael doesn\u2019t, either; a deputy governor doesn\u2019t sound important enough to know that sort of thing. \u201cThanks for the stay at the Season\u2019s End, by the way. The beds are very comfortable. And the food\u2019s delicious.\u201d\n\nThat, of course, does it. Asael stands as well. \u201cStay here. I\u2019ll go and speak with the governor.\u201d\n\nSo Syen smiles pleasantly, and sits back down to wait. Asael leaves the room, and stays gone for long enough that Syen starts to doze off. She recovers when the door opens again, and another Coaster woman, elderly and portly, comes in with a chastened-looking Asael. The governor\u2019s a man. Syenite sighs inwardly and braces herself for more weaponized politeness.\n\n\u201cSyenite Orogene,\u201d the woman says, and despite her rising ire Syenite is impressed by the gravity of her presence. The \u201corogene\u201d after Syen\u2019s name isn\u2019t necessary, of course, but it\u2019s a nice bit of much-needed courtesy\u2014so Syen rises, and the woman immediately steps forward and offers a hand for her to shake. Her skin is cool and dry and harder than Syenite expected. No calluses, just hands that have done their share of everyday labor. \u201cMy name is Heresmith Leadership Allia. I\u2019m the lieutenant governor. The governor genuinely is too busy to meet with you today, but I\u2019ve cleared enough time on my schedule, and I hope my greeting will be sufficient\u2026 especially as it comes with an apology for your poor treatment thus far. I can assure you that Asael will be censured for her behavior, to remind her that it\u2019s always good leadership to treat others\u2014all others\u2014with courtesy.\u201d\n\nWell. The woman could be just playing a politician\u2019s game, or she could be lying about being the lieutenant governor; maybe Asael\u2019s found a very well-dressed janitor to play the part. Still, it\u2019s an effort at compromise, and Syen will take it.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d she says, with genuine gratitude. \u201cI\u2019ll convey your apology to my colleague Alabaster.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood. Please also tell him that Allia will pay your expenses, per our agreed-upon contract, for up to three days before and three after your clearing of the harbor.\u201d And there\u2019s an edge to her smile now, which Syenite knows she probably deserves. This woman, it seems, actually has read the contract.\n\nDoesn\u2019t matter, though. \u201cI appreciate the clarification.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there anything else you need during your stay? Asael would be happy to provide a tour of the city, for example.\u201d\n\nDamn. Syen likes this woman. She stifles the urge to smile and glances at Asael, who\u2019s managed to compose herself by this point; she gazes impassively back at Syenite. And Syen\u2019s tempted to do what Alabaster probably would, and take Heresmith up on that tacit offer of Asael\u2019s humiliation. But Syenite is tired, and this whole trip\u2019s been hellish, and the sooner it\u2019s over and she\u2019s back home at the Fulcrum, the better.\n\n\u201cNo need,\u201d she says, and does Asael\u2019s face twitch a little in suppressed relief? \u201cI\u2019d actually like to get a look at the harbor, if I may, so that I can assess the problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. But surely you\u2019d like refreshment first? At least a cup of safe.\u201d\n\nSyenite can\u2019t help it now. Her lips twitch. \u201cI don\u2019t actually like safe, I should probably say.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one does.\u201d And there\u2019s no mistaking the genuine smile on Heresmith\u2019s face. \u201cAnything else, then, before we go?\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s Syen\u2019s turn to be surprised. \u201cYou\u2019re coming with us?\u201d\n\nHeresmith\u2019s expression grows wry. \u201cWell, our comm\u2019s livelihood is dependent on you, after all. It seems only proper.\u201d\n\nOh, yeah. This one\u2019s a keeper. \u201cThen please proceed, Heresmith Leader.\u201d Syenite gestures toward the door, and they all head out.\n\n* * *\n\nThe harbor\u2019s wrong.\n\nThey\u2019re standing on a kind of boardwalk along the western curve of the harbor\u2019s half circle. From there most of Allia can be seen, spreading up the caldera slopes that surround the waterfront. The city really is quite lovely. It\u2019s a beautiful day, bright and warm, with a sky so deep and clear that Syenite thinks the stargazing at night should be amazing. Yet it\u2019s what she can\u2019t see\u2014under the water, along the harbor bottom\u2014that makes her skin crawl.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not coral,\u201d she says.\n\nHeresmith and Asael turn to her, both of them looking puzzled. \u201cPardon?\u201d asks Heresmith.\n\nSyenite moves away from them, going to the railing and extending her hands. She doesn\u2019t need to gesture; she just wants them to know she\u2019s doing something. A Fulcrum orogene always reassures clients of their awareness and understanding of the situation, even when those clients have no actual idea what\u2019s going on. \u201cThe harbor floor. The top layer is coral.\u201d She thinks. She\u2019s never felt coral before, but it feels like what she expected: layers of wriggling bright life that she can pull from, if she needs to, to fuel her orogeny; and a solid core of ancient calcified death. But the coral heap sits atop a humped ridge in the floor of the harbor, and although it feels natural\u2014there are usually folds like this in places where land meets sea, she\u2019s read\u2014Syenite can tell it\u2019s not.\n\nIt\u2019s absolutely straight, for one thing. And huge; the ridge spans the width of the harbor. But more importantly, it isn\u2019t there.\n\nThe rock beneath the raised layers of silt and sand, that is: She can\u2019t feel it. She should be able to, if it\u2019s pushing up the seafloor like this. She can feel the weight of the water atop it, and the rock deformed by its weight and pressure underneath, and the strata around it, but not the actual obstruction itself. There might as well be a big empty hole on the bottom of the harbor\u2026 around which the entire harbor floor has shaped itself.\n\nSyenite frowns. Her fingers spread and twitch, following the flow and curve of the sesuna. Soft slither of loose schist and sand and organic matter, cool press of solid bedrock, flow and dip. As she follows it, she belatedly remembers to narrate her explorations. \u201cThere\u2019s something beneath the coral, buried in the ocean floor. Not far down. The rock underneath is compressed; it must be heavy\u2026\u201d But why can\u2019t she feel it, if so? Why can she detect the obstruction only by its effect on everything nearby? \u201cIt\u2019s strange.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it relevant?\u201d That\u2019s Asael, maybe trying to sound professional and intelligent in order to get back into Heresmith\u2019s good graces. \u201cAll we need is for the coral blockage to be destroyed.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but the coral\u2019s on top of it.\u201d She searches for the coral and finds it all around the edges of the harbor; a theory forms. \u201cThat\u2019s why this is the only place in the deep part of the harbor that\u2019s blocked by coral. It\u2019s growing on top of the thing, where the ocean floor has effectively been raised. Coral\u2019s a thing of the shallows, but it can get plenty of sun-warmed water, along this ridge.\u201d\n\n\u201cRusting Earth. Does that mean the coral will just grow back?\u201d That\u2019s one of the men who came with Asael and Heresmith. They\u2019re a bunch of clerks, as far as Syenite can tell, and she keeps forgetting they\u2019re present until they speak. \u201cThe whole point of this is to clear the harbor for good.\u201d", "characters": [{"name": "Syenite", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Asael", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Alabaster", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Heresmith Leadership Allia", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0021}}
{"story_id": "prince_of_thorns_scene_008", "text": "14\n\n\n\nSo we rode out from Norwood. The peasants watched us, all sullen and dazed, and Rike cursed them. As if it had been his idea to keep them from a Renar bonfire and now they owed him a cheer as he left. We left them the ruins of their town, decorated with the corpses of the men that ruined it. Poor compensation, especially after Rike and the brothers had stripped the dead of anything of worth. I reckoned we could make Crath City by nightfall, riding hard, and be banging on the gates of the Tall Castle before the moon rose.\n\nI shouldn\u2019t have been turning for home, picking up my old ways, and thinking once more about vengeance upon the Count of Renar. That\u2019s what instinct told me. But today instinct spoke with an old and dry voice and I no longer trusted it. I wanted to go home, perhaps because it felt as though something else required that I did not. I wanted to go home and if Hell rose up to stop me, it would make me desire it the more. We took the Castle Road, up through the garden lands of Ancrath. Our path ran alongside gentle streams, between small woods and quiet farms. I\u2019d forgotten how green it was. I\u2019d grown used to a world of churned mud, burned fields, smoke-grey skies, and the dead rotting on the ground. The sun found us, pushing its way through high cloud. In the warmth our column slowed until the clatter of hooves broke into lazy thuds. Gerrod paused where a three-bar gate led through the hedgerow. Beyond it, a field, golden with wheat, rolled out before us. He tore at the long grass around the gatepost. It felt as if God had poured honey over the land, sweet and slow, holding everything at peace. Norwood lay fifteen miles, and a thousand years, behind us.\n\n\u201cGood to be back, eh, Jorg?\u201d Makin pulled up beside me. He leaned forward in his stirrups and drank in the air. \u201cSmells of home.\u201d\n\nAnd it did. The scent of warm earth took me back, back to times when my world was small, and safe.\n\n\u201cI hate this place,\u201d I said. He looked shocked at that, and Makin was never an easy man to shock. \u201cIt\u2019s a poison men take willingly, knowing it will make them weak.\u201d\n\nI gave Gerrod my heels and let him hurry up the road. Makin caught me up and cantered alongside. We passed Rike and Burlow at the crossroads, throwing rocks at a scarecrow.\n\n\u201cMen fight for their homeland, Prince,\u201d Makin said. \u201cIt\u2019s the land they defend. The King and the land.\u201d\n\nI turned to holler at the stragglers. \u201cClose the line!\u201d\n\nMakin kept pace, waiting for an answer. \u201cLet the soldiers die for their land,\u201d I said to him. \u201cIf the time comes to sacrifice these fields in the cause of victory, I\u2019ll let them burn in a heartbeat. Anything that you cannot sacrifice pins you. Makes you predictable, makes you weak.\u201d\n\nWe rode on at a trot, west, trying to catch the sun.\n\nSoon enough we found the garrison at Chelny Ford. Or rather they found us. The watchtower must have seen us on the trail, and fifty men came out along the Castle Road to block our way.\n\nI pulled up a few yards short of the pikemen, strung across the road in a bristling hedge, double-ranked. The rest of the squad waited behind the pike-wall, with drawn swords, save for a dozen archers arrayed amongst the corn in the field to our right. A score of heifers, in the field opposite, saw our approach and idled over to investigate.\n\n\u201cMen of Chelny Ford,\u201d I called out. \u201cWell met. Who leads here?\u201d\n\nMakin came up behind me, the rest of the brothers trailing in after him, easy in their saddles.\n\nA tall man stepped forward between two pikemen, but not too far forward, no idiot this one. He wore the Ancrath colours over a long chain shirt, and an iron pot-helm low on his brow. To my right a dozen sets of white knuckles strained on bowstrings. To my left the heifers watched from behind the hedge, complacent and chewing on the cud.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Captain Coddin.\u201d He had to raise his voice as one of the cows let out a low moo. \u201cThe King signs mercenaries at Relston Fayre. Armed bands are not permitted to roam into Ancrath. State your business.\u201d He kept his eyes on Makin, looking for his answer there.\n\nI didn\u2019t care for being dismissed as a child, but there\u2019s a time and place for taking offence. Besides, old Coddin seemed to know his stuff. Putting Brother Gemt out of his misery was one thing, but wasting one of Father\u2019s captains quite another.\n\nI had my visor up already, so I used it to pull my helm off. \u201cFather Gomst!\u201d I called for the priest, and the brothers shuffled their horses aside with a few mutters to let the old fellow past. He wasn\u2019t much to look at. He\u2019d hacked off that beard he grew in the gibbet-cage, but grey tufts still decorated his face in random clusters, and his priestly robes seemed more mud than cloth.\n\n\u201cCaptain Coddin,\u201d I said. \u201cDo you know this priest, Father Gomst?\u201d\n\nCoddin raised an eyebrow at that. He had a pale face, and now it went paler. His mouth took on a hard edge, like a man who knows he\u2019s the butt of a joke that he hasn\u2019t worked out yet. \u201cAye,\u201d he said. \u201cThe King\u2019s priest.\u201d He snapped his heels together and inclined his head, as if he were in court. It seemed funny out there in the road, with the birds tweeting overhead and the stink of the cows washing over us.\n\n\u201cFather Gomst,\u201d I said. \u201cPray tell Captain Coddin who I am.\u201d\n\nThe old fellow puffed himself up a bit. He\u2019d been listless and grey since Norwood, but now he tried to find a crumb or two of authority.\n\n\u201cPrince Honorous Jorg Ancrath sits before you, Captain. Lost and now returned, he is bound for his royal father\u2019s court, and you would do well to see that he gets there with proper escort . . .\u201d He glanced at me, screwing up what courage he had behind the foolish remnants of his beard. \u201cAnd a bath.\u201d\n\nA little snigger went up at that, on both sides of our standoff. It doesn\u2019t pay to underestimate a cleric. They know the power of words and they\u2019ll use them to their own ends. My palm ached for the hilt of my sword. I saw old Gomst\u2019s head falling from his shoulders, bouncing once, twice, and rolling to a halt by the hooves of a black-and-white heifer. I pushed the vision away.\n\n\u201cNo bath. It\u2019s about time for a little road-stink at court. Soft words and rose water may please the gentry, but those that fight the war live dirty. I return to my father as a man who has shared the soldier\u2019s lot. Let him know the truth of it.\u201d I let my words carry on the still air, and kept my eyes on Gomsty. He had the wit to look away.\n\nMy speech earned no rousing cheer, but Coddin bowed his head and we had no further mention of baths. A shame, truth be told, because I\u2019d been looking forward to a hot tub ever since I decided to turn for home.\n\nSo Coddin left his second to command the garrison, and rode with us. His escort of two dozen riders swelled our numbers to nearly sixty. Makin carried a lance from the Ford armoury now, flying the Ancrath colours and royal crest. The garrison riders spread word through the villages as we passed. \u201cPrince Jorg, Prince Jorg returned from the dead.\u201d The news stole ahead of us, until each town presented a larger and better prepared reception. Captain Coddin sent a rider to the King before we left Chelny Ford, but even without his message, they would know of us in the Tall Castle well before we got there.\n\nAt Bains Town the bunting stretched across Main Street, six minstrels, sporting lute and clavichord, played \u201cThe King\u2019s Sword\u201d with more gusto than skill, jugglers exchanged twirling fire-brands, and a bear danced before the mill pond. And the crowds! People packed in so tight we\u2019d no hope of riding through. A fat woman in a tent of a dress which was striped like a tourney pavilion saw me amid the van. She pointed and gave a shriek that drowned the minstrels out, \u201cPrince Jorg! The Stolen Prince!\u201d The whole place went mad at that, cheering and crying. They surged forward like wild things. Coddin had his men in quick, though. I forgave him his earlier slight for that. If peasants had reached Rike, we\u2019d have had red slaughter.\n\nOn the Lich Road the brothers were more scared, but that\u2019s the only time I\u2019ve seen more fear in them than there at Bains Town. They none of them knew what to make of it. Grumlow\u2019s left hand never left his dagger. Red Kent grinned like a maniac, terror in his eyes. Still, they\u2019d learn fast enough. When they figured out the welcome that lay ahead. When they\u2019d seen the taverns and the whores. Well, there\u2019d be no dragging them out of Bains Town in a week.\n\nOne of the minstrels found a horn, and a harsh note cut through the tumult. Guards, red-robed with black chain beneath, cleared a path, and no less a man than Lord Nossar of Elm emerged before us. I recognized the man from court. He looked slightly fatter in his gilded show-plate and velvets, rather more grey in the beard spilling down over his breastplate, but pretty much the same jolly old Nossar who rode me on his shoulders once upon a time.\n\n\u201cPrince Jorg!\u201d The old man\u2019s voice broke for a moment. I could see tears shining in his eyes. It caught at me, that did. I felt it hook something in my chest. I didn\u2019t like it.\n\n\u201cLord Nossar,\u201d I gave back, and let a smile curl my lip. The same smile I gave Gemt before I let him have my knife. I saw a flicker in Nossar\u2019s eyes then. Just a moment of doubt.\n\nHe rallied himself. \u201cPrince Jorg! Beyond all hope, you\u2019ve returned to us. I cursed the messenger for a liar, but here you are.\u201d He had the deepest voice, rich and golden. Old Nossar spoke and you knew it was truth, you knew he liked you, it wrapped you up all warm and safe, that voice did. \u201cWill you honour my house, Prince Jorg, and stay a night?\u201d\n\nI could see the brothers exchanging glances, eyeing women in the crowd. The mill pond burned crimson with the dying sun. North, above the dark line of Rennat Forest, the smoke of Crath City stained a darkening sky.\n\n\u201cMy lord, it\u2019s a gracious invitation, but I mean to sleep in the Tall Castle tonight. I\u2019ve been away too long,\u201d I said.\n\nI could see the worry on him. It hung on every crag of the man\u2019s face. He wanted to say more, but not here. I wondered if Father set him to detain me.\n\n\u201cPrince . . .\u201d He lifted a hand, his eyes seeking mine.\n\nI felt that hook in my chest again. He would set me down in his high hall and talk of old times in that golden voice. He\u2019d speak of William, and Mother. If there was a man who could disarm me, Nossar was that man.\n\n\u201cI thank you for the welcome, Lord Nossar.\u201d I gave him court formality, curt and final.\n\nI had to haul on the reins to turn Gerrod. I think even horses liked Nossar. I led the brothers around by the river trail, trampling over some farmer\u2019s autumn turnips. The peasants cheered on, not sure what was happening, but cheering all the same.\n\nWe came to the Tall Castle by the cliff path, avoiding the sprawl of Crath City. The lights lay below us. Streets beaded with torchlight, the glow of fire and lamp rising from windows not yet shuttered against the cool of the night. The watchmen\u2019s lanterns picked out the Old City wall, a skewed semicircle, tapering down to the river where the houses spilled out beyond the walls, into the valley, reaching out along the river. We came to the West Gate, the one place we could reach the High City without trailing up through the narrow streets of the Old City. The guards raised the portcullises for us, first one, then the next, then the next. Ten minutes of creaking windlass and clanking chain. I wondered why the three gates were down. Did our foes truly press so close we must triple-gate the High Wall?\n\nThe gate captain came out whilst his men sweated to raise the last portcullis. Archers watched from the battlements high above. No bunting here. I recognized the man vaguely, as old as Gomst, salt-and-pepper hair. It was his sour expression I recalled best, pinched around the mouth as if he\u2019d just that moment sucked a lemon.\n\n\u201cPrince Jorg, we are told?\u201d He peered up at me, raising his torch almost to my face. Evidently I had enough of the King\u2019s look about me to satisfy his curiosity. He lowered the torch fast enough and took a step back. I\u2019m told I have my father\u2019s eyes. Maybe I do, though mine are darker. We could both give a stare that made men think again. I\u2019ve always thought I look too girlish. My mouth too much the rosebud, my cheekbones too high and fine. It\u2019s of no great consequence. I\u2019ve learned to wear my face as a mask, and generally I can write what I choose on it.\n\nThe captain nodded to Captain Coddin. He passed his gaze over Makin without a flicker, missed Father Gomst in the crowd, and lingered instead on the Nuban, before casting a dubious eye over Rike.\n\n\u201cI can find accommodation for your men in the Low City, Prince Jorg,\u201d he said. By the Low City he meant the sprawl beyond the walls of Old City.\n\n\u201cMy companions can board with me at the castle,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cKing Olidan requires only your presence, Prince Jorg,\u201d the gate captain said. \u201cAnd that of Father Gomst, and Captain Bortha if he is with you?\u201d\n\nMakin raised a mailed hand. Both the gate captain\u2019s eyebrows vanished up beneath his helm at that. \u201cMakin Bortha? No . . . ?\u201d\n\n\u201cOne and the same,\u201d Makin said. He gave the man a broad grin, showing altogether too many teeth. \u201cBeen a while, Relkin, you old bastard.\u201d\n\n\u201cKing Olidan requires\u201d . . . no room for manoeuvre there. A polite little \u201cget your road-scum down to the slums.\u201d At least Relkin made it clear enough from the start, rather than letting me lose face by arguing the odds before over-ruling me with \u201cKing Olidan requires.\u201d\n\n\u201cElban, take the brothers down to the river and find some rooms. There\u2019s a tavern, The Falling Angel, should be big enough for you all,\u201d I said.", "characters": [{"name": "Jorg", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Makin", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Rike", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Burlow", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Father Gomst", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Captain Coddin", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Glaward", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Grumlow", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0067}}
{"story_id": "storm_front_scene_009", "text": "Chapter Five\n\n\n\n\nMcAnally\u2019s is a pub a few blocks from my office. I go there when I\u2019m feeling stressed, or when I have a few extra bucks to spend on a nice dinner. A lot of us fringe types do. Mac, the pub\u2019s owner, is used to wizards and all the problems that come along with us. There aren\u2019t any video games at McAnally\u2019s. There are no televisions or expensive computer trivia games. There isn\u2019t even a jukebox. Mac keeps a player piano instead. It\u2019s less likely to go haywire around us.\n\nI say pub in all the best senses of the word. When you walk in, you take several steps down into a room with a deadly combination of a low clearance and ceiling fans. If you\u2019re tall, like me, you walk carefully in McAnally\u2019s. There are thirteen stools at the bar and thirteen tables in the room. Thirteen windows, set up high in the wall in order to be above ground level, let some light from the street into the place. Thirteen mirrors on the walls cast back reflections of the patrons in dim detail, and give the illusion of more space. Thirteen wooden columns, carved with likenesses from folktales and legends of the Old World, make it difficult to walk around the place without weaving a circuitous route\u2014they also quite intentionally break up the flow of random energies, dispelling to one degree or another the auras that gather around broody, grumpy wizards and keeping them from manifesting in unintentional and colorful ways. The colors are all muted, earth browns and sea greens. The first time I entered McAnally\u2019s, I felt like a wolf returning to an old, favorite den. Mac makes his own beer, ale really, and it\u2019s the best stuff in the city. His food is cooked on a wood-burning stove. And you can damn well walk your own self over to the bar to pick up your order when it\u2019s ready, according to Mac. It\u2019s my sort of place.\n\nSince the calls to the morgues had turned up nothing, I kept a few bills out of Monica Sells\u2019s retainer and took myself to McAnally\u2019s. After the kind of day I\u2019d had, I deserved some of Mac\u2019s ale and someone else\u2019s cooking. It was going to be a long night, too, once I went home and started trying to figure out how whoever it was had pulled off the death spell used on Johnny Marcone\u2019s hatchet man, Tommy Tomm, and his girlfriend, Jennifer Stanton.\n\n\u201cDresden,\u201d Mac greeted me, when I sat down at the bar. The dim, comfortable room was empty, but for a pair of men I recognized by sight at a back table, playing chess. Mac is a tall, almost gangly man of indeterminate age, though there\u2019s a sense to him that speaks of enough wisdom and strength that I wouldn\u2019t venture that he was less than fifty. He has squinty eyes and a smile that is rare and mischievous when it manifests. Mac never says much, but when he does it\u2019s almost always worth listening to.\n\n\u201cHey there, Mac,\u201d I hailed him. \u201cBeen one hell of a day. Give me a steak sandwich, fries, ale.\u201d\n\n\u201cUngh,\u201d Mac said. He opened a bottle of his ale and began to pour it warm, staring past me, into the middle distance. He does that with everyone. Considering his clientele, I don\u2019t blame him. I wouldn\u2019t chance looking them in the face, either.\n\n\u201cYou hear about what happened at the Madison?\u201d\n\n\u201cUngh,\u201d he confirmed.\n\n\u201cNasty business.\u201d\n\nSuch an inane comment apparently didn\u2019t merit even a grunted reply. Mac set my drink out and turned to the stove behind the bar, checking the wood and raking it back and forth to provide even heating for it.\n\nI picked up a prethumbed newspaper nearby and scanned the headlines. \u201cHey, look at this. Another ThreeEye rampage. Jesus, this stuff is worse than crack.\u201d The article detailed the virtual demolition of a neighborhood grocery store by a pair of ThreeEye junkies who were convinced that the place was destined to explode and wanted to beat destiny to the punch.\n\n\u201cUngh.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou ever seen anything like this?\u201d\n\nMac shook his head.\n\n\u201cThey say the stuff gives you the third sight,\u201d I said, reading the article. Both junkies had been admitted to the hospital and were in critical condition, after collapsing at the scene. \u201cBut you know what?\u201d\n\nMac looked back at me from the stove, while he cooked.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s possible. What a bunch of crap. Trying to sell these poor kids on the idea that they can do magic.\u201d\n\nMac nodded at me.\n\n\u201cIf it was serious stuff, the department would have already called me by now.\u201d\n\nMac shrugged, turning back to the stove. Then he squinted up and peered into the dim reflection of the mirror behind the bar.\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d he said, \u201cyou were followed.\u201d\n\nI had been too tense for too much of the day to avoid feeling my shoulders constrict in a sudden twinge. I put both hands around my mug and brought a few phrases of quasi-Latin to mind. It never hurt to be ready to defend myself, in case someone was intending to hurt me. I watched someone approach, a dim shape in the reflection cast by the ancient, worn mirror. Mac went on with cooking, unperturbed. Nothing much perturbed Mac.\n\nI smelled her perfume before I turned around. \u201cWhy, Miss Rodriguez,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s always pleasant to see you.\u201d\n\nShe came to an abrupt stop a couple of paces from me, apparently disconcerted. One of the advantages of being a wizard is that people always attribute anything you do to magic, if no other immediate explanation leaps to mind. She probably wouldn\u2019t think about her perfume giving her identity away when she could assign my mysterious, blind identification of her to my mystical powers.\n\n\u201cCome on,\u201d I told her. \u201cSit down. I\u2019ll get you a drink while I refuse to tell you anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarry,\u201d she admonished me, \u201cyou don\u2019t know I\u2019m here on business.\u201d She sat down on the barstool next to me. She was a woman of average height and striking, dark beauty, wearing a crisp business jacket and skirt, hose, pumps. Her dark, straight hair was trimmed in a neat cut that ended at the nape of her neck and was parted off of the dark skin of her forehead, emphasizing the lazy appeal of her dark eyes.\n\n\u201cSusan,\u201d I chided her, \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t be in this place if you weren\u2019t. Did you have a good time in Branson?\u201d\n\nSusan Rodriguez was a reporter for the Chicago Arcane, a yellow magazine that covered all sorts of supernatural and paranormal events throughout the Midwest. Usually, the events they covered weren\u2019t much better than \u201cMonkey Man Seen With Elvis\u2019s Love Child,\u201d or \u201cJFK\u2019s Mutant Ghost Abducts Shapeshifting Girl Scout.\u201d But once in a great, great while, the Arcane covered something that was real. Like the Unseelie Incursion of 1994, when the entire city of Milwaukee had simply vanished for two hours. Gone. Government satellite photos showed the river valley covered with trees and empty of life or human habitation. All communications ceased. Then, a few hours later, there it was, back again, and no one in the city itself the wiser.\n\nShe had also been hanging around my investigation in Branson the previous week. She had been tracking me ever since interviewing me for a feature story, right after I\u2019d opened up my business. I had to hand it to her\u2014she had instincts. And enough curiosity to get her into ten kinds of trouble. She had tricked me into meeting her eyes at the conclusion of our first interview, an eager young reporter investigating an angle on her interviewee. She was the one who had fainted after we\u2019d soulgazed.\n\nShe smirked at me. I liked her smirk. It did interesting things to her lips, and hers were already attractive. \u201cYou should have stayed around for the show,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was pretty impressive.\u201d She put her purse on the bar and slid up onto the stool beside me.\n\n\u201cNo thanks,\u201d I told her. \u201cI\u2019m pretty sure it wasn\u2019t for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy editor loved the coverage. She\u2019s convinced it\u2019s going to win an award of some kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can see it now,\u201d I told her. \u201c\u2018Mysterious Visions Haunt Drug-Using Country Star.\u2019 Real hard-hitting paranormal journalism, that.\u201d I glanced at her, and she met my eyes without fear. She didn\u2019t let me see if my gibe had ruffled her.\n\n\u201cI heard you got called in by the S.I. director today,\u201d she told me. She leaned toward me, enough that a glance down would have afforded an interesting angle to the V of her white shirt. \u201cI\u2019d love to hear you tell me about this one, Harry.\u201d She quirked a smile at me that promised things.\n\nI almost smiled back at her. \u201cSorry,\u201d I told her. \u201cI have a standard nondisclosure agreement with the city.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething off the record, then?\u201d she asked. \u201cRumor has it that these killings were pretty sensational.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t help you, Susan,\u201d I told her. \u201cWild horses couldn\u2019t drag it out of me, et cetera.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a hint,\u201d she pressed. \u201cA word of comment. Something shared between two people who are very attracted to one another.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich two people would that be?\u201d\n\nShe put an elbow on the counter and propped her chin in her hand, studying me through narrowed eyes and thick, long lashes. One of the things that appealed to me about her was that even though she used her charm and femininity relentlessly in pursuit of her stories, she had no concept of just how attractive she really was\u2014I had seen that when I looked within her last year. \u201cHarry Dresden,\u201d she said, \u201cyou are a thoroughly maddening man.\u201d Her eyes narrowed a bit further. \u201cYou didn\u2019t look down my blouse even once, did you?\u201d she accused.\n\nI took a sip of my ale and beckoned Mac to pour her one as well. He did. \u201cGuilty.\u201d\n\n\u201cMost men are off-balance by now,\u201d she complained. \u201cWhat does it take with you, anyway, Dresden?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am pure of heart and mind,\u201d I told her. \u201cI cannot be corrupted.\u201d\n\nShe stared at me in frustration for a moment. Then she tilted back her head to laugh. She had a good laugh, too, throaty and rich. I did look down at her chest when she did that, just for a second. A pure heart and mind only takes you so far\u2014sooner or later the hormones have their say, too. I mean, I\u2019m not a teenager or anything, anymore, but I\u2019m not exactly an expert in things like this, either. Call it an overwhelming interest in my professional career, but I\u2019ve never had much time for dating or the fair sex in general. And when I have, it hasn\u2019t turned out too well.\n\nSusan was a known quantity\u2014she was attractive, bright, appealing, her motivations were clear and simple, and she was honest in pursuing them. She flirted with me because she wanted information as much as because she thought I was attractive. Sometimes she got it. Sometimes she didn\u2019t. This one was way too hot for Susan or the Arcane to touch, and if Murphy heard I\u2019d tipped someone off about what had happened, she\u2019d have my heart between two pieces of bread for lunch.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, Harry,\u201d she said. \u201cHow about if I ask some questions, and you just answer them with a yes or a no?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said promptly. Dammit. I am a poor liar, and it didn\u2019t take a reporter with Susan\u2019s brains to tell it.\n\nHer eyes glittered with cheerfully malicious ambition. \u201cWas Tommy Tomm murdered by a paranormal being or means?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d I said again, stubbornly.\n\n\u201cNo, he wasn\u2019t?\u201d Susan asked. \u201cOr no, it wasn\u2019t a paranormal being?\u201d\n\nI glanced at Mac as though to appeal for help. Mac ignored me. Mac doesn\u2019t take sides. Mac is wise.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not going to answer questions,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cDo the police have any leads? Any suspects?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you a suspect yourself, Harry?\u201d\n\nDisturbing thought. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, exasperated. \u201cSusan\u2014\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you mind having dinner with me Saturday night?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! I\u2014\u201d I blinked at her. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nShe smiled at me, leaned over, and kissed me on the cheek. Her lips, which I\u2019d admired so much, felt very, very nice. \u201cSuper,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ll pick you up at your place. Say around nine?\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I just miss something?\u201d I asked her.\n\nShe nodded, dark eyes sparkling with humor. \u201cI\u2019m going to take you to a fantastic dinner. Have you ever eaten at the Pump Room? At the Ambassador East?\u201d\n\nI shook my head.\n\n\u201cSteaks you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d she assured me. \u201cAnd the most romantic atmosphere. Jackets and ties required. Can you manage?\u201d\n\n\u201cUm. Yes?\u201d I said, carefully. \u201cThis is the answer to the question of whether or not I\u2019ll go out with you, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d Susan said, with a smile. \u201cThat was the answer I tricked out of you, so you\u2019re stuck, there. I just want to make sure you own something besides jeans and button-down Western shirts.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. Yes,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cSuper,\u201d she repeated, and kissed me on the cheek once more as she stood up and gathered her purse. \u201cSaturday, then.\u201d She drew back and quirked her smirky little smile at me. It was a killer look, sultry and appealing. \u201cI\u2019ll be there. With bells on.\u201d\n\nShe turned and walked out. I sort of turned to stare after her. My jaw slid off the bar as I did and landed on the floor.\n\nHad I just agreed to a date? Or an interrogation session?\n\n\u201cProbably both,\u201d I muttered.\n\nMac slapped my steak sandwich and fries down in front of me. I put down some money, morosely, and he made change.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s going to do nothing but try to trick information out of me that I shouldn\u2019t be giving her, Mac,\u201d I said.\n\n\u201cUngh,\u201d Mac agreed.\n\n\u201cWhy did I say yes?\u201d\n\nMac shrugged.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s pretty,\u201d I said. \u201cSmart. Sexy.\u201d\n\n\u201cUngh.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny red-blooded man would have done the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHngh,\u201d Mac snorted.\n\n\u201cWell. Maybe not you.\u201d\n\nMac smiled a bit, mollified.\n\n\u201cStill. It\u2019s going to make trouble for me. I must be crazy to go for someone like that.\u201d I picked up my sandwich, and sighed.\n\n\u201cDumb,\u201d Mac said.\n\n\u201cI just said she was smart, Mac.\u201d\n\nMac\u2019s face flickered into that smile, and it made him look years younger, almost boyish. \u201cNot her,\u201d he said. \u201cYou.\u201d\n\nI ate my dinner. And had to admit that he was right.\n\nThis threw a wrench into my plans. My best idea for poking around the Sells lake house and getting information had to be carried out at night. And I already had tomorrow night slated for a talk with Bianca, since I had a feeling Murphy and Carmichael would fail to turn up any cooperation from the vampiress. That meant I would have to drive out to Lake Providence tonight, since Saturday night was now occupied by the date with Susan\u2014or at least the premidnight portion was.\n\nMy mouth went dry when I considered that maybe the rest of the night might be occupied, too. One never knew. She had dizzied me and made me look like an idiot, and she was probably going to try every trick she knew to drag more information out of me for the Monday morning release of the Arcane. On the other hand, she was sexy, intelligent, and at least a little attracted to me. That indicated that more might happen than just talk and dinner. Didn\u2019t it?\n\nThe question was, did I really want that to happen?\n\nI had been a miserable failure in relationships, ever since my first love went sour. I mean, a lot of teenage guys fail in their first relationships.\n\nNot many of them murder the girl involved.\n\nI shied away from that line of thought, lest it bring up too many old memories.\n\nI left McAnally\u2019s, after Mac had handed me a doggy bag with a grunt of \u201cMister,\u201d by way of explanation. The chess game in the corner was still in progress, both players puffing up a sweet-smelling smog cloud from their pipes. I tried to figure out how to deal with Susan, while I walked out to my car. Did I need to clean up my apartment? Did I have all the ingredients for the spell I would cast at the lake house later tonight? Would Murphy go through the roof when I talked to Bianca?\n\nI could still feel Susan\u2019s kiss lingering on my cheek as I got in the car.\n\nI shook my head, bewildered. They say we wizards are subtle. But believe you me, we\u2019ve got nothing, nothing at all, on women.", "characters": [{"name": "Harry Dresden", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Mac", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Susan Rodriguez", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Monica Sells", "role": "MINOR"}, {"name": "Johnny Marcone", "role": "ANTAGONIST"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0032}}
{"story_id": "a_little_hatred_scene_010", "text": "\u2018You killed this one,\u2019 said Isern. The lad knelt there, making these squeaky little gasps as he tried to reach around his back to the arrow shaft, though what he\u2019d do if he got his fingertips to it, Rikke had no idea. Probably he\u2019d no idea, either. Isern was the only one thinking clearly right then. She leaned down and calmly plucked the knife from the lad\u2019s belt. \u2018Was hoping to set him a question or two, but he\u2019ll be giving no answers with that shaft in his lung.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tAs if to prove the point, he coughed some blood into his hand, and stared over it at Rikke. He looked a bit offended, like she\u2019d said something hurtful.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Still, no one ever gets things all their own way.\u2019 Rikke jumped at the crack as Isern rammed the lad\u2019s knife into the crown of his head. His eyes rolled up and his leg kicked and his back arched. Just like hers did, maybe, when a fit came upon her.\n\n\t\t\tThe hairs were standing on Rikke\u2019s arms as he slumped down limp. She never saw a man killed before. All happened so fast she didn\u2019t know how she ought to feel about it.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018They didn\u2019t seem so bad,\u2019 she said.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018For a girl struggling to penetrate the mists of the future, you don\u2019t half miss what\u2019s right in front of you.\u2019 Isern was already rooting through the old man\u2019s pockets, point of her tongue wedged in the hole in her teeth. \u2018If you wait till they seem bad, you\u2019ve waited way too long.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Could\u2019ve given \u2019em a chance.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018To what? Put you in the mud? Or drag you off to Stour Nightfall? Chafing would\u2019ve been the least of your worries then, that boy\u2019s got a bastard of a reputation.\u2019 She caught the old man\u2019s leg and dragged him from the path into the undergrowth, tossed his spear after. \u2018Or were we going to invite \u2019em dancing through the woods with us, and all wear flowers in our hair and win \u2019em over to our side with my pretty words and your pretty smile?\u2019\n\n\t\t\tRikke spat some chagga juice and wiped her chin, watching the blood work its way through the dirt about the lad\u2019s nailed head. \u2018Doubt my smile\u2019s up to the task and I\u2019m damn sure your words ain\u2019t.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Then killing \u2019em was all o\u2019 the one choices we had, eh? Your problem is you\u2019re all heart.\u2019 And she stabbed Rikke in the tit with one bony finger.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Ow!\u2019 Rikke took a step away, holding her arms across her chest. \u2018That hurts, you know!\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018You\u2019re all heart all over, so you feel every sting and buffet. You must make of your heart a stone.\u2019 And Isern thumped her ribs with a fist, the finger bones around her neck rattling. \u2018Ruthlessness is a quality much loved o\u2019 the moon.\u2019 As if to prove the point, she bent down and heaved the dead lad into the bushes. \u2018A leader must be hard, so others don\u2019t have to be.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Leader o\u2019 what?\u2019 muttered Rikke, rubbing at her sore tit. And that was when she caught a whiff of smoke, just like in her dream. As if it was a tugging she couldn\u2019t resist, she set off down the path.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Oy!\u2019 called Isern around a stick of dry meat she\u2019d rooted out of the big one\u2019s pouch. \u2018I need help dragging this big bastard!\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018No,\u2019 whispered Rikke, the smell of fire getting stronger and her worry getting stronger with it. \u2018No, no, no.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tShe burst from the trees and into cold daylight, took a couple more wobbling steps and stopped, bow dangling from her limp hand.\n\n\t\t\tThe morning mist was long faded and she could see all the way across the patchwork of new-planted fields to Uffrith, wedged in against the grey sea behind its grey wall. Where her father\u2019s old hall stood with the scraggy garden out the back. Safe, boring Uffrith, where she\u2019d been born and raised. Only it was burning, just the way she\u2019d seen it, and a great column of dark smoke rolled up and smudged the sky, drifting out over the restless sea.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018By the dead,\u2019 she croaked.\n\n\t\t\tIsern wandered from the trees with her spear across her shoulders and a great smile across her face. \u2018You know what this means?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018War?\u2019 whispered Rikke, horrified.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Aye, that.\u2019 Isern waved it away like it was a trifle. \u2018But more to the matter, I was right!\u2019 And she clapped Rikke on the shoulder so hard she near knocked her down. \u2018You do have the Long Eye!\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t \t\t\tWhere the Fight\u2019s Hottest\n\n\t\t\tIn battle, Leo\u2019s father used to say, a man discovers who he truly is.\n\n\t\t\tThe Northmen were already turning to run as his horse crashed into them with a thrilling jolt.\n\n\t\t\tHe smashed one across the back of the helmet with the full force of the charge and ripped his head half off.\n\n\t\t\tHe snarled as he swung to the other side. A glimpse of a gawping face before his axe split it open, blood spraying in black streaks.\n\n\t\t\tOther riders tore into the Northmen, tossing them like broken dolls. He saw one horse spitted through the head with a spear. The rider turned a somersault as he was flung from the saddle.\n\n\t\t\tA lance shattered, a shard flying into Leo\u2019s helmet with an echoing clang as he wrenched away. The world was a flickering slit of twisted faces, glinting steel, heaving bodies, half seen through the slot in his visor. Screams of men and mounts and metal mashed into one thought-crushing din.\n\n\t\t\tA horse swerved in front of him. Riderless, stirrups flapping. Ritter\u2019s horse. He could tell by the yellow saddlecloth. A spear stabbed at him, jolting the shield on his arm, rocking him in his saddle. The point screeched down his armoured thigh.\n\n\t\t\tHe gripped the reins in his shield-hand as his mount bucked and snorted, face locked in an aching smile, flailing wildly with his axe on one side, then the other. He beat mindlessly at a shield with a black wolf painted on it, kicked at a man and sent him staggering back, then Barniva\u2019s sword flashed as it took his arm off.\n\n\t\t\tHe saw Whitewater Jin swinging his mace, red hair tangled across gritted teeth. Just beyond him, Antaup was shrieking something as he tried to twist his spear free of bloody mail. Glaward wrestled with a Carl, both without weapons, all tangled with their reins. Leo hacked at the Northman and smashed his elbow back the wrong way, hacked again and sent him flopping into the mud.\n\n\t\t\tHe pointed at Stour Nightfall\u2019s standard with his axe, black wolf streaming in the wind. He howled, roared, throat hoarse. No one could hear him with his visor down. No one could\u2019ve heard him if it had been up. He hardly knew what he was saying. He flailed furiously at the milling bodies instead.\n\n\t\t\tSomeone clutched at his leg. Curly hair. Freckles. Looked bloody terrified. Everyone did. Didn\u2019t seem to have a weapon. Maybe surrendering. Leo smashed Freckles on the top of the head with the rim of his shield, gave his horse the spurs and trampled him into the mud.\n\n\t\t\tThis was no place for good intentions. No place for tedious subtleties or boring counter-arguments. None of his mother\u2019s carping on patience and caution. Everything was beautifully simple.\n\n\t\t\tIn battle, a man discovers who he truly is, and Leo was the hero he\u2019d always dreamed of being.\n\n\t\t\tHe swung again but his axe felt strange. The blade had flown off, left him holding a bloody stick. He dropped it, dragged out his battle steel, buzzing fingers clumsy in his gauntlet, hilt greasy from the thickening rain. He realised the man he\u2019d been hitting was dead. He\u2019d fallen against the fence, so it looked as if he was standing but there was black pulp hanging out of his broken skull, so that was that.\n\n\t\t\tThe Northmen were crumbling. Running, squealing, being hacked down from behind, and Leo herded them towards their standard. Three riders had a whole crowd of them hemmed into a gateway, Barniva in their midst, scarred face flecked with blood as he chopped away with his heavy sword.\n\n\t\t\tThe standard-bearer was a huge man with desperate eyes and blood in his beard, still holding high the flag of the black wolf. Leo spurred right at him, blocked axe with shield, caught him with a sword-cut that screeched over his cheek guard and opened a great gash across his face, carved half his nose off. He tottered back and Whitewater Jin crushed the man\u2019s helmet with his mace, blood squirting from under the rim. Leo kicked him over, tearing the standard from his limp hand as he fell. He thrust it up, laughing, gurgling, half-choking on his own spit then laughing again, his axe\u2019s loop still stuck around his wrist so the broken haft clattered against his helmet.\n\n\t\t\tHad they won? He stared around for more enemies. A few ragged figures bounded through the crops towards the distant trees. Running for their lives, weapons abandoned. That was all.\n\n\t\t\tLeo ached all over: thighs from gripping his horse, shoulders from swinging his axe, hands from gripping the reins. The very soles of his feet throbbed from the effort. His chest heaved, breath booming in his helmet, damp, and hot, and tasting of salt. Might\u2019ve bit his tongue somewhere. He fumbled with the buckle under his chin, finally tore the damn thing free. His skull burst with the noise, turned from fury to delight. The noise of victory.\n\n\t\t\tHe almost fell from his horse, clambered up onto the wall. Something was soft under his gauntleted hand. A Northman\u2019s corpse, a broken spear sticking from his back. All he felt was giddy joy.\n\n\t\t\tNo corpses, no glory, after all. Might as well regret the peelings from a carrot. Someone was helping him up, giving him a steadying hand. Jurand. Always there when he needed him. Leo stood tall, the joyful faces of his men all turned towards him.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018The Young Lion!\u2019 roared Glaward, climbing up beside him and clapping a heavy hand on his shoulder, making him wobble. Jurand stretched out his arms to catch him, but he didn\u2019t fall. \u2018Leo dan Brock!\u2019 Soon they were all shouting his name, singing it like a prayer, chanting it like a magic word, stabbing their glittering weapons at the spitting sky.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Leo! Leo! Leo!\u2019\n\n\t\t\tIn battle, a man discovers who he truly is.\n\n\t\t\tHe felt drunk. He felt on fire. He felt like a king. He felt like a god. This was what he was made for!\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Victory!\u2019 he roared, shaking his bloody sword and the Northmen\u2019s bloody standard.\n\n\t\t\tBy the dead, could there be anything better than this?\n\n\n\n\t\t\tIn the lady governor\u2019s tent, they were fighting a different kind of war. A war of patient study and careful calculation, of weighed odds and furrowed brows, of lines of supply and an awful lot of maps. A kind of war Leo frankly hadn\u2019t the patience for.\n\n\t\t\tThe glow of victory had been dampened by the stiffening rain on the long trudge up from the valley, doused further by the niggling pain from a dozen cuts and bruises, and was almost entirely smothered by the cool stare his mother gave him as Leo pushed through the flap with Jurand and Whitewater Jin at his back.\n\n\t\t\tShe was in the midst of talking to a knight herald. Ridiculously tall, he had to stoop respectfully to attend to her.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018\u2026 please tell His Majesty we are doing everything to check the Northmen\u2019s advance, but Uffrith is lost and we are giving ground. They struck with overwhelming force at three points and we are still gathering our troops. Ask him \u2026 no, beg him to send reinforcements.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018I will, my Lady Governor.\u2019 The knight herald nodded to Leo as he passed. \u2018My congratulations on your victory, Lord Brock.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018We don\u2019t need the king\u2019s bloody help!\u2019 snapped Leo as soon as the flap dropped. \u2018We can beat Black Calder\u2019s dogs!\u2019 His voice sounded oddly weak in the tent, deadened by wet cloth. It didn\u2019t carry anywhere near so nicely as it had on the battlefield.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Huh.\u2019 His mother planted her fists on the table and frowned down at her maps. By the dead, sometimes he thought she loved those maps more than him. \u2018If we are to fight the king\u2019s battles, we should expect the king\u2019s help.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018You should\u2019ve seen them run!\u2019 Damn it, but Leo had been so sure of himself a few moments ago. He could charge a line of Carls and never falter, but a woman with a long neck and greying hair leached all the courage out of him. \u2018They broke before we even got to them! We took a few dozen prisoners \u2026\u2019 He glanced towards Jurand, but he was giving Leo that doubtful look now, the one he used when he didn\u2019t approve, the one he\u2019d given him before the charge. \u2018And the farm\u2019s back in our hands \u2026 and \u2026\u2019\n\n\t\t\tHis mother let him stammer into silence before she glanced at his friends. \u2018My thanks, Jurand. I\u2019m sure you did your best to talk him out of it. And you, Whitewater. My son couldn\u2019t ask for better friends or I for braver warriors.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tJin slapped a heavy hand down on Leo\u2019s shoulder. \u2018It was Leo who led the\u2014\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018You can go.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tJin scratched sheepishly at his beard, showing a lot less warrior\u2019s mettle than he had down in the valley. Jurand gave Leo the slightest apologetic wince. \u2018Of course, Lady Finree.\u2019 And they slunk from the tent, leaving Leo to fiddle weakly with the fringe of his captured standard.\n\n\t\t\tHis mother let the withering silence stretch a moment longer before she passed judgement. \u2018You bloody fool.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tHe\u2019d known it was coming, but it still stung. \u2018Because I actually fought?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Because of when you chose to fight, and how.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Great leaders go where the fight\u2019s hottest!\u2019 But he knew he sounded like the heroes in the badly written storybooks he used to love.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018You know who else you find where the fight\u2019s hottest?\u2019 asked his mother. \u2018Dead men. We both know you\u2019re not a fool, Leo. For whose benefit are you pretending to be one?\u2019 She shook her head wearily. \u2018I should never have let your father send you to live with the Dogman. All you learned in Uffrith was rashness, bad songs and a childish admiration for murderers. I should have sent you to Adua instead. I doubt your singing would be any better but at least you might have learned some subtlety.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018There\u2019s a time for subtlety and a time for action!\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018There is never a time for recklessness, Leo. Or for vanity.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018We bloody won!\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Won what? A worthless farm in a worthless valley? That was little more than a scouting party, and now the enemy will guess our strength.\u2019 She gave a bitter snort as she turned back to her maps. \u2018Or the lack of it.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018I captured a standard.\u2019 It seemed a pitiful thing now he really looked at it, though, clumsily stitched, the pole closer to a branch than a flagstaff. How could he have thought Stour Nightfall himself might ride beneath it?\n\n\t\t\t\u2018We have plenty of flags,\u2019 said his mother. \u2018It\u2019s men to follow them we\u2019re short of. Perhaps you could bring back a few regiments of those next time?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Damn it, Mother, I don\u2019t know how to please you\u2014\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Listen to what you\u2019re told. Learn from those who know better. Be brave, by all means, but don\u2019t be rash. Above all, don\u2019t get yourself bloody killed! You\u2019ve always known exactly how to please me, Leo, but you choose to please yourself.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018You can\u2019t understand! You\u2019re not \u2026\u2019 He waved an impatient hand, failing, as always, to quite find the right words. \u2018A man,\u2019 he finished lamely.\n\n\t\t\tShe raised one brow. \u2018Had I been confused on that point, it was put beyond doubt when I pushed you out of my womb. Have you any notion how much you weighed as a baby? Spend two days shitting an anvil and we\u2019ll talk again.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Bloody hell, Mother! I mean that men will look up to a certain kind of man, and\u2014\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Like your friend Ritter looked up to you?\u2019\n\n\t\t\tLeo was caught out by the memory of that riderless horse clattering past. He realised he hadn\u2019t seen Ritter\u2019s face among his friends when they celebrated. Realised he hadn\u2019t even thought about that until now.", "characters": [{"name": "Rikke", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Isern", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Stour Nightfall", "role": "ANTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Leo dan Brock", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Jurand", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Whitewater Jin", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Barniva", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0044}}
{"story_id": "a_little_hatred_scene_011", "text": "\u2018By the dead,\u2019 she heard the woman mutter above, and then, with forced good cheer, \u2018Chief! How\u2019s the day?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Bloodless so far, but it\u2019s still early.\u2019 The voice of Stour Nightfall himself, then. A whining sort of voice for a famous warrior. Sounded like a boy on the edge of a tantrum. \u2018They\u2019re thin sauce, these Southerners, always trickling away. The Bloody-Nine had Rudd Threetrees to fight, and Black Dow, and Harding Grim and all the rest. How\u2019s a man meant to win a great name without great enemies to weigh it against?\u2019\n\n\t\t\tA brief pause. \u2018It\u2019s a tester, all right,\u2019 said the woman.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018I\u2019ve a task for you, Wonderful. There\u2019s a girl out in these woods.\u2019 Rikke had a bad feeling in her stomach. Worse than the hunger, and she shrank against the bank like she could become one with the dirt. \u2018I want her.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tA snorting chuckle from the enthusiastic pisser. \u2018Well, who wouldn\u2019t want a girl out in the woods?\u2019 There was a silence, like the jest had miscarried. Certainly Rikke wasn\u2019t fucking laughing. \u2018How do we tell this girl from another?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018They say she\u2019s got a twitchy way. She\u2019ll have a gold ring through her nose, maybe a cross painted over her eye.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tRikke touched the tip of her tongue to the ring through her nose and whispered, \u2018Fuck.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018She might have some witch of a hillwoman with her. That you can kill. But the girl we need alive.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Must be important,\u2019 said the woman called Wonderful.\n\n\t\t\tNightfall gave a little hooting giggle. \u2018Well, there\u2019s the thing. She\u2019s the Dogman\u2019s daughter.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Double fuck,\u2019 mouthed Rikke.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Shhhhhhh,\u2019 hissed Isern.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018What happens if we catch her?\u2019\n\n\t\t\tAn unhappy grunt. \u2018Well, if my father gets her, I daresay he\u2019ll ransom her back, dangle her as bait, use her to get his way when it comes to talking peace.\u2019 And Nightfall spat out the word like it tasted bad. \u2018You know my father. Plans within plans.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Always been clever, Black Calder,\u2019 came the man\u2019s voice.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018I see things different. How I see it, the way you break your enemy is you break what they love. Way I hear it, those old fools on the other side love that twitching bitch. Sort of a little mascot for \u2019em.\u2019 Rikke heard the smile in his voice. \u2018So if I get hold of her, I\u2019ll strip her, and whip her, and pull her teeth out, and maybe get some Thralls to fuck her, out between the lines where everyone can hear her squealing.\u2019 Bit of a silence, and Rikke heard her own breath coming ragged, and Isern\u2019s hand tightening around her arm. \u2018Or maybe I\u2019d get my horse to fuck her. Or my dogs. Or \u2026 like, a pig, maybe?\u2019\n\n\t\t\tThe older man sounded more than a touch disgusted. \u2018How the hell would you do that?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018There\u2019s naught you can\u2019t do if you\u2019ve the imagination and the patience. Then I\u2019ll bind her up in the trees with brambles where everyone can see, and cut the bloody cross in her, and put a bucket underneath to catch her guts, and send \u2019em to the other side.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018What, her guts?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Aye, in a pretty box. Hardwood, nicely carved. With flowers, maybe. Or no! Herbs. So those old fools won\u2019t smell what they\u2019re getting till they open it.\u2019 And he gave a satisfied grunt, like he was talking about a nice fish he\u2019d catch, or a nice meal he\u2019d eat, or a nice sit on the porch he couldn\u2019t wait to have at sunset. \u2018Imagine the looks on their faces.\u2019 And he chuckled like her guts in a box would be quite the height of drollery.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Fuck,\u2019 breathed Rikke.\n\n\t\t\tIsern just whispered, \u2018Shhhhhhhhh \u2026\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018But that\u2019s for later.\u2019 And Nightfall gave a disappointed sigh. \u2018Can\u2019t cook what you haven\u2019t caught, can you? My father\u2019s offering a big gild for her, that\u2019s sure. Whoever brings her in\u2019ll be a wealthy man.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tThe woman called Wonderful sounded like she was hardly enjoying this any more than Rikke was. \u2018Right y\u2019are, Chief. We\u2019ll be looking.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Lovely. You can get back to your pissing now, Clover.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018That\u2019s all right. Won\u2019t need another for a while, I reckon.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tRikke heard soft footfalls moving away. Perhaps she should\u2019ve been frozen with fear. The dead knew she\u2019d a right to be. But what she felt instead was a boiling fury. A fury that warmed her through despite the icy water frothing to her chin. A fury that tempted her to slip from the stream with her knife between her teeth and cut the bloody cross in Stour Nightfall right then and there.\n\n\t\t\tRikke\u2019s father had always told her vengeance was a waste of effort. That letting it go was the strong thing, the wise thing, the right thing. That blood only led to more blood. But his lessons seemed far away now, meant for a warmer place. She clenched her jaw, and narrowed her eyes, and swore to herself that if she lived out the week, she\u2019d make it her business to see Stour Nightfall fucked by a pig.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018I\u2019ll be honest, Wonderful,\u2019 came the man\u2019s voice, the one called Clover, speaking soft like he was sharing a secret, \u2018I\u2019m finding that bastard increasingly troubling.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Aye, I know.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Took it for an act at first, but I\u2019m starting to think he\u2019s everything he pretends to be.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Aye, I know.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Guts in a box? With herbs?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Aye, I know.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018He\u2019ll be king one o\u2019 these days, will guts-in-a-box over yonder. King o\u2019 the Northmen. Him.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tA long pause, then a weary grunt. \u2018It\u2019s a thing no right-thinking person could look forward to.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tRikke could only agree. She thought she saw a hint of their reflections, dancing among the black branches in the water.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018You see something down there?\u2019\n\n\t\t\tShe stiffened, numb fingers curling tight around the grip of her knife. She saw the jaw muscles clench on the side of Isern\u2019s face, blade of her spear sliding from the water, smeared with pitch so it wouldn\u2019t catch the light.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018What? Fish?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Aye. Worth getting my rod, d\u2019you think?\u2019\n\n\t\t\tThe sound of Wonderful hawking up, then a glob of phlegm came spinning over from above and plopped into the water. \u2018Nothing in this stream worth catching, I reckon.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t \t\t\tIt Was Bad\n\n\t\t\tThe sun was setting when he came home, just a pink glimmer over black hills. The valley was in darkness but Broad could\u2019ve walked the way blindfold. Knew every rut in the track, every stone in the tumbledown wall beside it.\n\n\t\t\tAll so familiar. But all so strange.\n\n\t\t\tAfter two years away, you\u2019d think a man would run headlong towards a place he loved, the people he loved, with the biggest smile his cheeks could hold. But Broad trudged slow as the condemned to the scaffold, and smiled about as much, too. The man who left had feared nothing. The one coming back was scared all the time. He hardly even knew what of. Himself, maybe.\n\n\t\t\tWhen he saw the house, huddled among those bare trees, lamplight showing around the shutters, he had this strange urge to walk on. This strange thought he didn\u2019t belong there any more. Not with what he\u2019d seen. Not with what he\u2019d done. What if he trod it in with him?\n\n\t\t\tBut the path leading past was a coward\u2019s path. He clenched his aching fists. Gunnar Broad was no coward. Ask anyone.\n\n\t\t\tTook all the courage he had to knock on that door, though. More than it had to climb the ladders at Borletta, or lead the charge into those pikes at Musselia, or even carry those men dying of the grip in the long winter after. But he knocked.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Who is it?\u2019 Her voice, beyond the door, and it made him wince worse than the points of those pikes had. Till that moment, he\u2019d been afraid she wouldn\u2019t be there. That she\u2019d have moved on. Forgotten him. Or maybe he\u2019d been hoping she would\u2019ve.\n\n\t\t\tHe could hardly find any voice at all. \u2018It\u2019s me, Liddy. It\u2019s Gunnar.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tThe door rattled open, and there she stood. She\u2019d changed. Not near as much as he had, but she\u2019d changed. Leaner, maybe. Harder, maybe. But when she smiled, it still lit the gloomy world, the way it always had.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018What are you doing knocking at your own door, you big fool?\u2019\n\n\t\t\tAnd he just started crying. A jolting sob first that came all the way from his stomach. Then there was no stopping it. He fumbled his eye-lenses off with a trembling hand and all the tears he hadn\u2019t shed in Styria, on account of Gunnar Broad being no coward, came burning down his crushed-up face.\n\n\t\t\tLiddy stepped forward and he shrank away, hunched and hurting, arms up as if to fend her off. Like she was made of glass and might shatter in his hands. She caught him even so. Thin arms, but a hold he couldn\u2019t break, and though she was a head shorter than him, she held his face against her chest, and kissed his head, and whispered, \u2018Shhhh, now. Shhhhh.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tAfter a while, when his sobs started to calm, she put her hands on his cheeks and lifted his head so she was looking straight up at him, calm and serious.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018It was bad, then, was it?\u2019 she asked him.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Aye,\u2019 he croaked out. \u2018It was bad.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tShe smiled. That smile that lit up the world. Close enough that even without his lenses he could actually see it. \u2018But you\u2019re home now.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Aye. I\u2019m home now.\u2019 And he set to crying again.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tThe thunk of the axe made Broad flinch. He told himself it was the sound of honest work done well. He told himself he was home, safe, far from the battlefield. But maybe he\u2019d brought the battlefield home with him. Maybe the battlefield was whatever dirt he stood on now. He tried to hide it under a joke.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018I still say chopping wood is man\u2019s work.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tMay set another log on the block and hefted the axe. \u2018When the men sod off to Styria, it all becomes women\u2019s work.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tWhen he left, she\u2019d been boyish, quiet, awkward. As if her skin didn\u2019t fit her. She was bony still, but there was a quick strength in the way she moved. She\u2019d grown up fast. She\u2019d had to. Another thunk and two more neat pieces of wood went tumbling.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018I should\u2019ve stayed here and sent you off to fight,\u2019 said Broad. \u2018Maybe we\u2019d have won.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tMay smiled at him, and he smiled that he could make her smile, and wondered that someone who\u2019d done all the bad he\u2019d done could\u2019ve had a hand in making something as good as she was.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Where\u2019d you get the lenses?\u2019 she asked.\n\n\t\t\tBroad touched a finger to them. Sometimes forgot they were even on his face, till he took \u2019em off and everything beyond arm\u2019s reach became a smudge. \u2018I saved a man. Lord Marshal Mitterick.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Sounds fancy.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Commander o\u2019 the army, no less. There was an ambush, and I happened to be there, and, well \u2026\u2019 He realised he\u2019d bunched his fists trembling tight again and forced them open. \u2018He thought I\u2019d saved him. But I had to admit I\u2019d no clue who he was till after the business was done, since I couldn\u2019t see further than five strides. So he got me these as a gift.\u2019 He took the lenses off, and breathed on them, and wiped them carefully with the hem of his shirt. \u2018Probably cost six months of a soldier\u2019s pay. Miracle o\u2019 the modern age.\u2019 And he hooked them back over his ears, and into the familiar groove across the bridge of his nose. \u2018But I\u2019m grateful, \u2019cause now I can appreciate my daughter\u2019s beauty even halfway across the yard.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Beauty.\u2019 And she gave a scornful snort but looked just a bit pleased at the same time. The sun broke through and was warm on Broad\u2019s smile, and for a moment it was like it had been before. As if he never went.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018So you fought, then?\u2019\n\n\t\t\tBroad\u2019s mouth felt dry of a sudden. \u2018I fought.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018What was it like?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Well \u2026\u2019 All that time spent dreaming of her face and now she was looking right at him, it was hard to meet her eye. \u2018It was bad.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018I tell everyone my father\u2019s a hero.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tBroad winced. The clouds shifted and cast the yard into shadow, and the dread was at his shoulder again. \u2018Don\u2019t tell \u2019em that.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018What should I tell \u2019em?\u2019\n\n\t\t\tHe frowned down at his aching hands, rubbed at one with the other. \u2018Not that.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018What do the marks mean?\u2019\n\n\t\t\tBroad tried to twitch his shirt cuff down over the Ladderman\u2019s tattoo, but the blue stars on his knuckles still showed. \u2018Just something the boys I was with did.\u2019 And he slipped his hand behind him. Where May couldn\u2019t see it. Where he didn\u2019t have to.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018But\u2014\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Enough questions,\u2019 said Liddy, stepping out onto the porch. \u2018Your father just got back.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018And I\u2019ve got plenty to do,\u2019 he said, standing. They must\u2019ve been working hard to keep the house presentable, but it was too much for three, let alone two, looked like it was crumbling back into the land. \u2018Must be half a dozen leaks to mend.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Be careful. Put your weight on the roof, I\u2019ve a feeling the whole house might fall down.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Wouldn\u2019t be surprised. I\u2019ll check on our flock first, though. I hear the price for wool\u2019s never better, what with all these new mills. They up the valley?\u2019\n\n\t\t\tMay blinked over at her mother, and Liddy gave an odd kind of grimace, and Broad felt that dread pressing on him all the heavier. \u2018What is it?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018We don\u2019t have a flock no more, Gunnar.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018What?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018I wanted to give you a proper night\u2019s sleep without having to worry.\u2019 Liddy heaved up a sigh seemed to come right from her worn shoes. \u2018Lord Isher fenced the valley in. Said we couldn\u2019t graze there any more.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tBroad hardly understood what she was saying. \u2018The valley\u2019s common land. Always has been.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Not any more. King\u2019s edict. It\u2019s happening all over. Next valley, too. We had to sell the flock to him.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018We had to sell him our sheep so he could graze \u2019em on our land?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018He gave us a good price. Some lords didn\u2019t give their tenants that much.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018So I get fucked when I go to war and I get fucked when I come back?\u2019 he snarled. The voice hardly sounded like his. \u2018You didn\u2019t \u2026 do anything?\u2019\n\n\t\t\tLiddy\u2019s eyes were hard. \u2018I couldn\u2019t think of anything to do. Maybe you could\u2019ve, but you weren\u2019t here.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018None o\u2019 this works without a flock!\u2019 His father had raised sheep, and his grandfather, and his grandfather\u2019s grandfather. Felt like the whole world had come unravelled. \u2018What\u2019ll we do?\u2019 He found he\u2019d clenched his fists again. He was shouting but he couldn\u2019t stop. \u2018What\u2019ll we do?\u2019\n\n\t\t\tAnd he saw May\u2019s lip trembling like she was about to cry, and Liddy put an arm around her, and all the anger drained out of him and left him cold and desperate.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 He\u2019d sworn never to lose his temper again. Sworn he\u2019d live for the two of them, give them a good life, and he\u2019d fucked it up a few hours through the door. \u2018I\u2019m sorry.\u2019 He took a step towards them, lifting a hand, then saw the tattoos on the knuckles and jerked it back.\n\n\t\t\tLiddy spoke soft and steady, looking him in the eye. \u2018We\u2019ve no choice, Gunnar. Isher offered to buy us out and we\u2019ve got to go. Valbeck, I was thinking. There\u2019s work in Valbeck. In the new mills.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tBroad could only stare at her. And in the silence, he heard the sound of horses, and turned towards the track.\n\n\t\t\tThere were three men coming up it. Coming slow, like they had all day to get there. One on a big chestnut. Two on a wagon with a creaky wheel. Gunnar recognised the driver. Lennart Seldom, the miller\u2019s younger brother. Broad had always reckoned him a coward and there was nothing in his shifty squint now to change his opinion.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018It\u2019s Lennart Seldom,\u2019 he muttered.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018It is,\u2019 said Liddy. \u2018May, get inside.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018But Ma\u2014\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Inside.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tThe other two, Broad didn\u2019t know. A long, lean one sat by Seldom, swaying with the jolting of the cart, a big flatbow across his knees. Wasn\u2019t loaded, which was a good thing, as they\u2019d a habit of going off at the worst times, but Broad couldn\u2019t see any reason for him to have it even so. A weapon for killing men. Or at least for threatening to.\n\n\t\t\tHe liked the look of the last rider even less. Big and bearded, with a fancy cavalry sword hanging low at his side, and a fancy three-cornered hat on his head, and a fancy way of sitting his saddle and looking around like this was his land.\n\n\t\t\tHe reined his horse in closer to the house than was polite, twisted his hat off, scrubbing at his flattened hair with his nails, considering Broad in thoughtful silence. Seldom brought the wagon to a halt behind him, between the two big lichen-spattered gateposts Gunnar\u2019s grandfather had carved on the boundary.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Gunnar,\u2019 he said, shifty eyes flicking to Liddy and back.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Seldom.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tLiddy tidied a stray strand of hair behind her ear, and the wind took it right away and set it flicking about her worried face again.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018You\u2019re back, then.\u2019 If Seldom was trying to sound happy about it, he fell well short. \u2018Where\u2019d you get the lenses?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018In Styria.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018How was it?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Bad,\u2019 said Broad.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Looks like you lost weight.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tThe one with the flatbow flashed a crooked grin. \u2018How big did he use to be?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Even bigger,\u2019 said the bearded one, barely giving Broad a glance as he settled his hat back on. \u2018Evidently.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Too little food and too much shitting, I guess,\u2019 said Broad.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018The soldier\u2019s curse,\u2019 said the bearded one. \u2018Name\u2019s Marsh.\u2019 He bit the words off short like he didn\u2019t care for talking and wanted to spend as little time at it as he could.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018I\u2019m Able,\u2019 said the thin one. \u2018We work for Lord Isher.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018What kind of work?\u2019 asked Broad, though it was plain from the weapons.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018This and that. Buying up property, mostly. This is Isher\u2019s valley\u2014\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018This bit of it ain\u2019t,\u2019 said Broad.\n\n\t\t\tMarsh gave an unhappy grunt, stretched his chin forward to scratch at his beard.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018You can\u2019t make a living here, Gunnar.\u2019 Seldom gave a wheedling little chuckle. \u2018You know that. Not now there\u2019s no grazing. To be fair to Isher, the king\u2019s hiked up his taxes neck high to pay for his bloody wars. There\u2019s land getting fenced in all over. Worked with machines.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Efficiency,\u2019 grunted Marsh, not even looking round.\n\n\t\t\tHis not caring a shit made Broad care all the more. \u2018My father died on this land,\u2019 he said, struggling to keep his voice down. \u2018Fighting the Gurkish.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018I know. Mine, too.\u2019 Seldom shrugged. \u2018But what can I do?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018You just do what you\u2019re told, eh?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018If I don\u2019t, someone else will.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Progress,\u2019 grunted Marsh.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Is it?\u2019 Broad frowned up the valley, towards the other houses, all sitting quiet. He\u2019d thought it was strange, that there was no smoke from the chimneys. \u2018Turned all these others out already, did you? Lant and his daughters, and the Barrows, and Old Neiman?\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Neiman died, but the rest sold up.\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018We made \u2019em see the sense in it,\u2019 said Able, shifting that flatbow in his lap.\n\n\t\t\t\u2018So why\u2019s my wife still here?\u2019\n\n\t\t\tSeldom sneaked another shifty glance at Liddy. \u2018Just wanted to give her some more time, \u2019cause we all know each other and\u2014\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018You always liked her. I understand. I like her myself. That\u2019s why I married her.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tLiddy had a worried, warning note in her voice. \u2018Gunnar\u2014\u2019\n\n\t\t\t\u2018Why she married me, I couldn\u2019t say. But she did.\u2019\n\n\t\t\tSeldom gave a watery effort at a smile. \u2018Look, friend\u2014\u2019", "characters": [{"name": "Rikke", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Isern", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Stour Nightfall", "role": "ANTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Wonderful", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Clover", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Gunnar Broad", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Liddy", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "May", "role": "MINOR"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0042}}
{"story_id": "hyperion_scene_012", "text": "Colonel Fedmahn Kassad laughed softly. \u2018The Ousters don\u2019t want to occupy Hyperion,\u2019 he said. \u2018If they take the planet they\u2019ll loot what they want and then do what they do best. They\u2019ll burn the cities into charred rubble, break the rubble into smaller pieces, and then bake the pieces until they glow. They\u2019ll melt the poles, boil the oceans, and then use the residue to salt what\u2019s left of the continents so nothing will ever grow there again.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Well . . .\u2019 began Father Hoyt and then trailed off.\n\n\n\nThere was no conversation as the clones cleared the soup and salad dishes and brought on the main course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018You said that there was a Hegemony warship escorting us,\u2019 the Consul said to Het Masteen as they finished their roast beef and boiled sky squid.\n\n\n\nThe Templar nodded and pointed. The Consul squinted but could make out nothing moving against the rotating starfield.\n\n\n\n\u2018Here,\u2019 said Fedmahn Kassad and leaned across Father Hoyt to hand the Consul a collapsible pair of military binoculars.\n\n\n\nThe Consul nodded his thanks, thumbed on the power, and scanned the patch of sky Het Masteen had indicated. Gyroscopic crystals in the binoculars hummed slightly as they stabilized the optics and swept the area in a programmed search pattern. Suddenly the image froze, blurred, expanded, and steadied.\n\n\n\nThe Consul could not avoid an involuntary intake of breath as the Hegemony ship filled the viewer. Neither the expected field-blurred seed of a solo ramscout nor the bulb of a torchship, the electronically outlined image was of a matte-black attack carrier. The thing was impressive in the way only warships through the centuries had succeeded in being. The Hegemony spinship was incongruously streamlined with its four sets of boom arms retracted in battle readiness, its sixty-meter command probe sharp as a Clovis point, and its Hawking drive and fusion blisters set far back along the launch shaft like feathers on an arrow.\n\n\n\nThe Consul handed the binoculars back to Kassad without comment. If the task force was using a full attack carrier to escort the Yggdrasill, what kind of firepower were they setting in place to meet the Ouster invasion?\n\n\n\n\u2018How long until we land?\u2019 asked Brawne Lamia. She had been using her comlog to access the treeship\u2019s datasphere and obviously was frustrated with what she had found. Or had not found.\n\n\n\n\u2018Four hours until orbit,\u2019 murmured Het Masteen. \u2018A few minutes more by dropship. Our consular friend has offered his private craft to ferry you down.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018To Keats?\u2019 said Sol Weintraub. It was the first time the scholar had spoken since dinner had been served.\n\n\n\nThe Consul nodded. \u2018It\u2019s still the only spaceport on Hyperion set to handle passenger vehicles,\u2019 he said.\n\n\n\n\u2018Spaceport?\u2019 Father Hoyt sounded angry. \u2018I thought that we were going straight to the north. To the Shrike\u2019s realm.\u2019\n\n\n\nHet Masteen patiently shook his head. \u2018The pilgrimage always begins from the capital,\u2019 he said. \u2018It will take several days to reach the Time Tombs.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Several days,\u2019 snapped Brawne Lamia. \u2018That\u2019s absurd.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Perhaps,\u2019 agreed Het Masteen, \u2018but it is the case, nonetheless.\u2019\n\n\n\nFather Hoyt looked as if something in the meal had caused him indigestion even though he had eaten almost nothing. \u2018Look,\u2019 he said, \u2018couldn\u2019t we change the rules this once \u2013 I mean, given the war scare and all? And just land near the Time Tombs or wherever and get it over with?\u2019\n\n\n\nThe Consul shook his head. \u2018Spacecraft and aircraft have been trying to take the short route to the northern moors for almost four hundred years,\u2019 he said. \u2018I know of none who made it.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018May one inquire,\u2019 said Martin Silenus, happily raising his hand like a schoolboy, \u2018just what the gibbering fuck happens to these legions of ships?\u2019\n\n\n\nFather Hoyt frowned at the poet. Fedmahn Kassad smiled slightly. Sol Weintraub said, \u2018The Consul did not mean to suggest that the area is inaccessible. One may travel by ship or various land routes. Nor do spacecraft and aircraft disappear. They easily land near the ruins or the Time Tombs and just as easily return to whatever point their computers command. It is merely the pilots and passengers who are never seen again.\u2019 Weintraub lifted the sleeping baby from his lap and set her in an infant carrier slung around his neck.\n\n\n\n\u2018So the tired old legend goes,\u2019 said Brawne Lamia. \u2018What do the ship logs show?\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Nothing,\u2019 said the Consul. \u2018No violence. No forced entry. No deviation from course. No unexplained time lapses. No unusual energy emissions or depletions. No physical phenomena of any sort.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018No passengers,\u2019 said Het Masteen.\n\n\n\nThe Consul did a slow double take. If Het Masteen had, indeed, just attempted a joke, it was the first sign in all of the Consul\u2019s decades of dealing with the Templars that one of them had shown even a nascent sense of humour. What the Consul could see of the Captain\u2019s vaguely oriental features beneath the cowl gave no hint that a joke had been attempted.\n\n\n\n\u2018Marvelous melodrama,\u2019 laughed Silenus. \u2018A real-life, Christ-weeping Sargasso of Souls and we\u2019re for it. Who orchestrates this shitpot of a plot, anyway?\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Shut up,\u2019 said Brawne Lamia. \u2018You\u2019re drunk, old man.\u2019\n\n\n\nThe Consul sighed.

{"story_id": "hyperion_scene_013", "text": "\u2018Agreed,\u2019 said the Consul, suddenly curious to hear the others tell their stories and equally sure that he would never tell his own. \u2018Those in favor of telling our tales?\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Sol Weintraub.\n\n\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Het Masteen.\n\n\n\n\u2018Absolutely,\u2019 said Martin Silenus. \u2018I wouldn\u2019t miss this little comic farce for a month in the orgasm baths on Shote.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018I vote yes also,\u2019 said the Consul, surprising himself. \u2018Those opposed?\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Nay,\u2019 said Father Hoyt but there was no energy in his voice.\n\n\n\n\u2018I think it\u2019s stupid,\u2019 said Brawne Lamia.\n\n\n\nThe Consul turned to Kassad. \u2018Colonel?\u2019\n\n\n\nFedmahn Kassad shrugged.\n\n\n\n\u2018I register four yes votes, two negatives, and one abstention,\u2019 said the Consul. \u2018The ayes have it. Who wants to start?\u2019\n\n\n\nThe table was silent. Finally Martin Silenus looked up from where he had been writing on a small pad of paper. He tore a sheet into several smaller strips. \u2018I\u2019ve recorded numbers from one to seven,\u2019 he said. \u2018Why don\u2019t we draw lots and go in the order we draw?\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018That seems rather childish, doesn\u2019t it?\u2019 said M. Lamia.\n\n\n\n\u2018I\u2019m a childish fellow,\u2019 responded Silenus with his satyr\u2019s smile. \u2018Ambassador\u2019 \u2013 he nodded toward the Consul \u2013 \u2018could I borrow that gilded pillow you\u2019re wearing for a hat?\u2019\n\n\n\nThe Consul handed over his tricorne, the folded slips were dropped in, and the hat passed around. Sol Weintraub was the first to draw, Martin Silenus the last.\n\n\n\nThe Consul unfolded his slip, making sure that no one else could see it. He was number seven. Tension ebbed out of him like air out of an overinflated balloon. It was quite possible, he reasoned, that events would intercede before he had to tell his story. Or the war would make everything academic. Or the group could lose interest in stories. Or the king could die. Or the horse could die. Or he could teach the horse how to talk.\n\n\n\nNo more whiskey, thought the Consul.\n\n\n\n\u2018Who\u2019s first?\u2019 asked Martin Silenus.\n\n\n\nIn the brief silence, the Consul could hear leaves stirring to unfelt breezes.\n\n\n\n\u2018I am,\u2019 said Father Hoyt. The priest\u2019s expression showed the same barely submerged acceptance of pain which the Consul had seen on the faces of terminally ill friends. Hoyt held up his slip of paper with a large 1 clearly scrawled on it.\n\n\n\n\u2018All right,\u2019 said Silenus. \u2018Start.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Now?\u2019 asked the priest.\n\n\n\n\u2018Why not?\u2019 said the poet. The only sign that Silenus had finished at least two bottles of wine was a slight darkening of the already ruddy cheeks and a somewhat more demonic tilt to the pitched eyebrows. \u2018We have a few hours before planetfall,\u2019 he said, \u2018and I for one plan to sleep off the freezer fugue when we\u2019re safely down and settled among the simple natives.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Our friend has a point,\u2019 Sol Weintraub said softly. \u2018If the tales are to be told, the hour after dinner each day is a civilized time to tell them.\u2019\n\n\n\nFather Hoyt sighed and stood. \u2018Just a minute,\u2019 he said and left the dining platform.\n\n\n\nAfter some minutes had passed, Brawne Lamia said, \u2018Do you think he\u2019s lost his nerve?\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018No,\u2019 said Lenar Hoyt, emerging from the darkness at the head of the wooden escalator which served as the main staircase. \u2018I needed these.\u2019 He dropped two small, stained notebooks on the table as he took his seat.\n\n\n\n\u2018No fair reading stories from a primer,\u2019 said Silenus. \u2018These are to be our own tall tales, Magus!\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Shut up, damn it!\u2019 cried Hoyt. He ran a hand across his face, touched his chest. For the second time that night, the Consul knew that he was looking at a seriously ill man.\n\n\n\n\u2018I\u2019m sorry,\u2019 said Father Hoyt. \u2018But if I\u2019m to tell my . . . my tale, I have to tell someone else\u2019s story as well. These journals belong to the man who was the reason for my coming to Hyperion . . . and why I am returning today.\u2019 Hoyt took a deep breath.\n\n\n\nThe Consul touched the journals. They were begrimed and charred, as if they had survived a fire. \u2018Your friend has old-fashioned tastes,\u2019 he said, \u2018if he still keeps a written journal.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u2018Yes,\u2019 said Hoyt. \u2018If you\u2019re all ready, I will begin.\u2019\n\n\n\nThe group at the table nodded. Beneath the dining platform, a kilometer of treeship drove through the cold night with the strong pulse of a living thing. Sol Weintraub lifted his sleeping child from the infant carrier and carefully set her on a cushioned mat on the floor near his chair. He removed his comlog, set it near the mat, and programmed the diskey for white noise. The week-old infant lay on her stomach and slept.\n\n\n\nThe Consul leaned far back and found the blue and green star which was Hyperion. It seemed to grow larger even as he watched. Het Masteen drew his cowl forward until only shadows showed for his face. Sol Weintraub lighted a pipe. Others accepted refills of coffee and settled back in their chairs.\n\n\n\nMartin Silenus seemed the most avid and expectant of the listeners as he leaned forward and whispered:\u2018He seyde, \u201cSyn I shal bigynne the game,\n\nWhat, welcome be the cut, a Goddes name!\n\nNow lat us ryde, and herkneth what I seye.\u201d\n\nAnd with that word we ryden forth oure weye;\n\nAnd he bigan with right a myrie cheere\n\nHis tale anon, and seyde as ye may heere.\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PRIEST\u2019S TALE: \u2018The Man Who Cried God\u2019\n\n\n\n\n\n\u2018Sometimes there is a thin line separating orthodox zeal from apostasy,\u2019 said Father Lenar Hoyt.\n\n\n\nSo began the priest\u2019s story. Later, dictating the tale into his comlog, the Consul remembered it as a seamless whole, minus the pauses, hoarse voice, false starts, and small redundancies which were the timeless failings of human speech.\n\n\n\nLenar Hoyt had been a young priest, born, raised, and only recently ordained on the Catholic world of Pacem, when he was given his first offworld assignment: he was ordered to escort the respected Jesuit Father Paul Dur\u00e9 into quiet exile on the colony world of Hyperion.\n\n\n\nIn another time, Father Paul Dur\u00e9 certainly would have become a bishop and perhaps a pope. Tall, thin, ascetic, with white hair receding from a noble brow and eyes too filled with the sharp edge of experience to hide their pain, Paul Dur\u00e9 was a follower of St Teilhard as well as an archaeologist, ethnologist, and eminent Jesuit theologian. Despite the decline of the Catholic Church into what amounted to a half-forgotten cult tolerated because of its quaintness and isolation from the mainstream of Hegemony life, Jesuit logic had not lost its bite. Nor had Father Dur\u00e9 lost his conviction that the Holy Catholic Apostolic Church continued to be humankind\u2019s last, best hope for immortality.\n\n\n\nTo Lenar Hoyt as a boy, Father Dur\u00e9 had been a somewhat godlike figure when glimpsed during his rare visits to the pre-seminary schools, or on the would-be seminarian\u2019s even rarer visits to the New Vatican. Then, during the years of Hoyt\u2019s study in seminary, Dur\u00e9 had been on an important Church-sponsored archaeological dig on the nearby world of Armaghast. When the Jesuit returned, a few weeks after Hoyt\u2019s ordination, it had been under a cloud. No one outside the highest circles of the New Vatican knew precisely what had happened, but there were whispers of excommunication and even of a hearing before the Holy Office of the Inquisition, dormant the four centuries since the confusion following the death of Earth.", "characters": [{"name": "the Consul", "role": "PROTAGONIST"}, {"name": "Sol Weintraub", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Het Masteen", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Martin Silenus", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Father Lenar Hoyt", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Brawne Lamia", "role": "SUPPORTING"}, {"name": "Fedmahn Kassad", "role": "SUPPORTING"}], "metadata": {"genre": "modern", "source": "validation", "entity_density": 0.0064}}
